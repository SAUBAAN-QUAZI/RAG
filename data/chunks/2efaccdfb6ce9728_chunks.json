An important insight brought by large language models is that knowledge\nof the world and languages can be acquired through large-sca le language modeling tasks, and\nin this way, we can create a universal model that handles dive rse problems. This discovery has\nprofoundly impacted the research methodologies in natural language processing and many related\ndisciplines. We have shifted from training specialized sys tems from scratch using a large amount\nof labeled data to a new paradigm of using large-scale pre-tr aining to obtain foundation models,\nwhich are then ﬁne-tuned, aligned, and prompted.\nThis book aims to outline the basic concepts of large languag e models and introduce the\nrelated techniques. As the title suggests, the book focuses more on the foundational aspects of\nlarge language models rather than providing comprehensive coverage of all cutting-edge methods.\nThe book consists of four chapters:\n• Chapter 1 introduces the basics of pre-training. This is th e foundation of large language\nmodels, and common pre-training methods and model architec tures will be discussed here.\n• Chapter 2 introduces generative models, which are the larg e language models we commonly\nrefer to today. After presenting the basic process of buildi ng these models, we will also\nexplore how to scale up model training and handle long texts.\n• Chapter 3 introduces prompting methods for large language models. We will discuss var-\nious prompting strategies, along with more advanced method s such as chain-of-thought\nreasoning and automatic prompt design.\n• Chapter 4 introduces alignment methods for large language models. This chapter focuses\non instruction ﬁne-tuning and alignment based on human feed back.\nIf readers have some background in machine learning and natu ral language processing, along\nwith a certain understanding of neural networks like Transf ormers, reading this book will be quite\neasy. However, even without this prior knowledge, it is stil l perfectly ﬁne, as we have made the\ncontent of each chapter as self-contained as possible, ensu ring that readers will not be burdened\nwith too much reading difﬁculty.\nIn writing this book, we have gradually realized that it is mo re like a compilation of \"notes\" we\nhave taken while learning about large language models. Thro ugh this note-taking writing style, we\nhope to offer readers a ﬂexible learning path. Whether they w ish to dive deep into a speciﬁc area\nor gain a comprehensive understanding of large language mod els, they will ﬁnd the knowledge\nand insights they need within these \"notes\".\nWe would like to thank the students in our laboratory and all o ur friends who have shared\nwith us their views on large language models and helped with c orrections of errors in writing. In\nparticular, we wish to thank Weiqiao Shan, Yongyu Mu, Chengl ong Wang, Kaiyan Chang, Yuchun\nFan, Hang Zhou, Xinyu Liu, Huiwen Bao, Tong Zheng, Junhao Rua n, and Qing Yang.\nii\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nNotation\navariable\narow vector or matrix\nf(a)function ofa\nmaxf(a)maximum value of f(a)\narg maxaf(a)value ofathat maximizes f(a)\nxinput token sequence to",

During the same period, pre-training also\nattracted signiﬁcant interest in computer vision, where th e backbone models were trained on rel-\natively large labeled datasets such as ImageNet, and then ap plied to different downstream tasks\n[He et al. ,2019 ;Zoph et al. ,2020 ]. Large-scale research on pre-training in NLP began with th e\ndevelopment of language models using self-supervised lear ning. This family of models covers\nseveral well-known examples like BERT [Devlin et al. ,2019 ] and GPT [Brown et al. ,2020 ], all\nwith a similar idea that general language understanding and generation can be achieved by train-\ning the models to predict masked words in a huge amount of text . Despite the simple nature of\nthis approach, the resulting models show remarkable capabi lity in modeling linguistic structure,\nthough they are not explicitly trained to achieve this. The g enerality of the pre-training tasks\nleads to systems that exhibit strong performance in a large v ariety of NLP problems, even outper-\nforming previously well-developed supervised systems. Mo re recently, pre-trained large language\nmodels have achieved a greater success, showing the excitin g prospects for more general artiﬁcial\nintelligence [ Bubeck et al. ,2023 ].\nThis chapter discusses the concept of pre-training in the co ntext of NLP. It begins with a gen-\neral introduction to pre-training methods and their applic ations. BERT is then used as an example\nto illustrate how a sequence model is trained via a self-supe rvised task, called masked language\nmodeling . This is followed by a discussion of methods for adapting pre -trained sequence mod-\nels for various NLP tasks. Note that in this chapter, we will f ocus primarily on the pre-training\nparadigm in NLP, and therefore, we do not intend to cover deta ils about generative large language\nmodels. A detailed discussion of these models will be left to subsequent chapters.\n1.1 Pre-training NLP Models\nThe discussion of pre-training issues in NLP typically invo lves two types of problems: sequence\nmodeling (or sequence encoding) and sequence generation. W hile these problems have different\n1\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\n2 Pre-training\nforms, for simplicity, we describe them using a single model deﬁned as follows:\no=g(x0,x1,...,x m;θ)\n=gθ(x0,x1,...,x m) (1.1)\nwhere {x0,x1,...,x m}denotes a sequence of input tokens1,x0denotes a special symbol ( ⟨s⟩or\n[CLS] ) attached to the beginning of a sequence, g(·;θ)(also written as gθ(·)) denotes a neural\nnetwork with parameters θ, and odenotes the output of the neural network.

To adapt the model to these\ntasks, we need to adjust the parameters ˆθslightly using labeled data or prompt the model\nwith task descriptions.\nIn this section, we discuss the basic ideas in addressing the se issues.\n1.1.1 Unsupervised, Supervised and Self-supervised Pre-t raining\nIn deep learning, pre-training refers to the process of opti mizing a neural network before it is\nfurther trained/tuned and applied to the tasks of interest. This approach is based on an assumption\nthat a model pre-trained on one task can be adapted to perform another task. As a result, we do\nnot need to train a deep, complex neural network from scratch on tasks with limited labeled data.\nInstead, we can make use of tasks where supervision signals a re easier to obtain. This reduces the\nreliance on task-speciﬁc labeled data, enabling the develo pment of more general models that are\nnot conﬁned to particular problems.\nDuring the resurgence of neural networks through deep learn ing, many early attempts to\nachieve pre-training were focused on unsupervised learning . In these methods, the parame-\nters of a neural network are optimized using a criterion that is not directly related to speciﬁc tasks.\nFor example, we can minimize the reconstruction cross-entr opy of the input vector for each layer\n[Bengio et al. ,2006 ]. Unsupervised pre-training is commonly employed as a prel iminary step\nbefore supervised learning, offering several advantages, such as aiding in the discovery of better\nlocal minima and adding a regularization effect to the train ing process [ Erhan et al. ,2010 ]. These\nbeneﬁts make the subsequent supervised learning phase easi er and more stable.\nA second approach to pre-training is to pre-train a neural ne twork on supervised learning\ntasks. For example, consider a sequence model designed to en code input sequences into some\n1Here we assume that tokens are basic units of text that are sep arated through tokenization. Sometimes, we will use\nthe terms token andword interchangeably, though they have closely related but slig htly different meanings in NLP.\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\n1.1 Pre-training NLP Models 3\nrepresentations. In pre-training, this model is combined w ith a classiﬁcation layer to form a clas-\nsiﬁcation system. This system is then trained on a pre-train ing task, such as classifying sentences\nbased on sentiment (e.g., determining if a sentence conveys a positive or negative sentiment).\nThen, we adapt the sequence model to a downstream task. We bui ld a new classiﬁcation system\nbased on this pre-trained sequence model and a new classiﬁca tion layer (e.g., determining if a\nsequence is subjective or objective). Typically, we need to ﬁne-tune the parameters of the new\nmodel using task-speciﬁc labeled data, ensuring the model i s optimally adjusted to perform well\non this new type of data. The ﬁne-tuned model is then employed to classify new sequences for\nthis task. An advantage of supervised pre-training is that t he training process, either in the pre-\ntraining or ﬁne-tuning phase, is straightforward, as it fol lows the well-studied general paradigm\nof supervised learning in machine learning. However, as the complexity of the neural network\nincreases, the demand for more labeled data also grows. This , in turn, makes the pre-training task\nmore difﬁcult, especially when large-scale labeled data is not available.\nA third approach to pre-training is self-supervised learning . In this approach, a neural net-\nwork is trained using the supervision signals generated by i tself, rather than those provided by\nhumans. This is generally done by constructing its own train ing tasks directly from unlabeled\ndata, such as having the system",

While s elf-supervised learning has recently\nemerged as a very popular method in NLP, it is not a new concept . In machine learning, a related\nconcept is self-training where a model is iteratively improved by learning from the ps eudo labels\nassigned to a dataset. To do this, we need some seed data to bui ld an initial model. This model\nthen generates pseudo labels for unlabeled data, and these p seudo labels are subsequently used to\niteratively reﬁne and bootstrap the model itself. Such a met hod has been successfully used in sev-\neral NLP areas, such as word sense disambiguation [ Yarowsky ,1995 ] and document classiﬁcation\n[Blum and Mitchell ,1998 ]. Unlike the standard self-training method, self-supervi sed pre-training\nin NLP does not rely on an initial model for annotating the dat a. Instead, all the supervision sig-\nnals are created from the text, and the entire model is traine d from scratch. A well-known example\nof this is training sequence models by successively predict ing a masked word given its preceding\nor surrounding words in a text. This enables large-scale sel f-supervised learning for deep neural\nnetworks, leading to the success of pre-training in many und erstanding, writing, and reasoning\ntasks.\nFigure 1.1shows a comparison of the above three pre-training approach es. Self-supervised\npre-training is so successful that most current state-of-t he-art NLP models are based on this\nparadigm. Therefore, in this chapter and throughout this bo ok, we will focus on self-supervised\npre-training. We will show how sequence models are pre-trai ned via self-supervision and how the\npre-trained models are applied.\n1.1.2 Adapting Pre-trained Models\nAs mentioned above, two major types of models are widely used in NLP pre-training.\n•Sequence Encoding Models . Given a sequence of words or tokens, a sequence encoding\nmodel represents this sequence as either a real-valued vect or or a sequence of vectors, and\nobtains a representation of the sequence. This representat ion is typically used as input to\nanother model, such as a sentence classiﬁcation system.\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\n4 Pre-training\nUnsupervised SupervisedPre-training Training\nUnlabeled\nDataLabeled\nData\n(a) Unsupervised Pre-trainingSupervised SupervisedPre-training Tuning\nLabeled\nData\nTask 1Labeled\nData\nTask 2\n(b) Supervised Pre-trainingSelf-\nSupervisedSupervisedZero/Few\nShot Learning\nPre-training TuningPrompting\nUnlabeled\nDataLabeled\nData\n(c) Self-supervised Pre-training\nFig. 1.1: Illustration of unsupervised, supervised, and self-super vised pre-training.

In NLP, sequence generation generally refers to the prob-\nlem of generating a sequence of tokens based on a given contex t. The term context has\ndifferent meanings across applications. For example, it re fers to the preceding tokens in\nlanguage modeling, and refers to the source-language seque nce in machine translation2.\nWe need different techniques for applying these models to do wnstream tasks after pre-training.\nHere we are interested in the following two methods.\n1.1.2.1 Fine-tuning of Pre-trained Models\nFor sequence encoding pre-training, a common method of adap ting pre-trained models is ﬁne-\ntuning. Let Encode θ(·)denote an encoder with parameters θ, for example, Encode θ(·)can be a\nstandard Transformer encoder. Provided we have pre-traine d this model in some way and obtained\nthe optimal parameters ˆθ, we can employ it to model any sequence and generate the corre sponding\nrepresentation, like this\nH= Encode ˆθ(x) (1.2)\nwhere xis the input sequence {x0,x1,...,x m}, and His the output representation which is a\nsequence of real-valued vectors {h0,h1,...,hm}. Because the encoder does not work as a stan-\ndalone NLP system, it is often integrated as a component into a bigger system. Consider, for\nexample, a text classiﬁcation problem in which we identify t he polarity (i.e., positive, negative,\n2More precisely, in auto-regressive decoding of machine tra nslation, each target-language token is generated based\non both its preceding tokens and source-language sequence.\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\n1.1 Pre-training NLP Models 5\nand neutral) of a given text. We can build a text classiﬁcatio n system by stacking a classiﬁer\non top of the encoder. Let Classifyω(·)be a neural network with parameters ω. Then, the text\nclassiﬁcation model can be expressed in the form\nPrω,ˆθ(·|x) = Classifyω(H)\n= Classifyω(Encode ˆθ(x)) (1.3)\nHere Prω,ˆθ(·|x)is a probability distribution over the label set {positive,negative,neutral }, and\nthe label with the highest probability in this distribution is selected as output. To keep the notation\nuncluttered, we will use Fω,ˆθ(·)to denote Classifyω(Encode ˆθ(·)).\nBecause the model parameters ωandˆθare not optimized for the classiﬁcation task, we cannot\ndirectly use this model. Instead, we must use a modiﬁed versi on of the model that is adapted to\nthe task. A typical way is to ﬁne-tune the model by giving expl icit labeling in downstream tasks.\nWe can train Fω,ˆθ(·)on a labeled dataset, treating it as a common supervised lear ning task. The\noutcome of the ﬁne-tuning is the parameters ˜ωand˜θthat are further optimized. Alternatively,\nwe can freeze the encoder parameters ˆθto maintain their pre-trained state, and focus solely on\noptimizingω. This allows the classiﬁer to be efﬁciently adapted to work i n tandem with the\npre-trained encoder.\nOnce we have obtained a ﬁne-tuned model, we can use it to class ify a new text. For example,\nsuppose we have a comment posted on a travel website:\nI love the food here. It’s amazing!\nWe ﬁrst tokenize this text into tokens3, and then",

This makes the adaption\nof pre-trained models very efﬁcient in practice: given a pre -trained model and a downstream task,\nwe just need to collect some labeled data, and slightly adjus t the model parameters on this data. A\nmore detailed discussion of ﬁne-tuning can be found in Secti on1.4.\n1.1.2.2 Prompting of Pre-trained Models\nUnlike sequence encoding models, sequence generation mode ls are often employed independently\nto address language generation problems, such as question a nswering and machine translation,\nwithout the need for additional modules. It is therefore str aightforward to ﬁne-tune these models\n3The text can be tokenized in many different ways. One of the si mplest is to segment the text into English words\nand punctuations {I,love,the,food,here,.,It,’s,amazing,!}\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\n6 Pre-training\nas complete systems on downstream tasks. For example, we can ﬁne-tune a pre-trained encoder-\ndecoder multilingual model on some bilingual data to improv e its performance on a speciﬁc trans-\nlation task.\nAmong various sequence generation models, a notable exampl e is the large language models\ntrained on very large amounts of data. These language models are trained to simply predict the next\ntoken given its preceding tokens. Although token predictio n is such a simple task that it has long\nbeen restricted to “language modeling” only, it has been fou nd to enable the learning of the general\nknowledge of languages by repeating the task a large number o f times. The result is that the\npre-trained large language models exhibit remarkably good abilities in token prediction, making\nit possible to transform numerous NLP problems into simple t ext generation problems through\nprompting the large language models. For example, we can fra me the above text classiﬁcation\nproblem as a text generation task\nI love the food here. It’s amazing! I’m\nHere indicates the word or phrase we want to predict (call it the completion ). If the predicted\nword is happy , orglad, orsatisﬁed or a related positive word, we can classify the text as positive .\nThis example shows a simple prompting method in which we conc atenate the input text with I’m\nto form a prompt. Then, the completion helps decide which lab el is assigned to the original text.\nGiven the strong performance of language understanding and generation of large language\nmodels, a prompt can instruct the models to perform more comp lex tasks. Here is a prompt where\nwe prompt the LLM to perform polarity classiﬁcation with an i nstruction.\nAssume that the polarity of a text is a label chosen from {posi tive, negative,\nneutral}.

Additionally, the ﬁne-tuning\nprocess is crucial for aligning the values of these models wi th human values. More detailed\ndiscussions of ﬁne-tuning can be found in Chapter 4.\n1.2 Self-supervised Pre-training Tasks\nIn this section, we consider self-supervised pre-training approaches for different neural architec-\ntures, including decoder-only, encoder-only, and encoder -decoder architectures. We restrict our\ndiscussion to Transformers since they form the basis of most pre-trained models in NLP. How-\never, pre-training is a broad concept, and so we just give a br ief introduction to basic approaches\nin order to make this section concise.\n1.2.1 Decoder-only Pre-training\nThe decoder-only architecture has been widely used in devel oping language models [ Radford et al. ,\n2018 ]. For example, we can use a Transformer decoder as a language model by simply removing\ncross-attention sub-layers from it. Such a model predicts t he distribution of tokens at a position\ngiven its preceding tokens, and the output is the token with t he maximum probability. The stan-\ndard way to train this model, as in the language modeling prob lem, is to minimize a loss function\nover a collection of token sequences. Let Decoder θ(·)denote a decoder with parameters θ. At\neach position i, the decoder generates a distribution of the next tokens bas ed on its preceding\ntokens {x0,...,x i}, denoted by Prθ(·|x0,...,x i)(orpθ\ni+1for short).

For\nnotation simplicity, we will sometimes drop the superscrip tsWandθafﬁxed to each probability\ndistribution.\nThe difference between this model and standard language mod els is that the output pihas\ndifferent meanings in encoder pre-training and language mo deling. In language modeling, piis\nthe probability distribution of predicting the next word. T his follows an auto-regressive decoding\nprocess: a language model only observes the words up to posit ioniand predicts the next. By\ncontrast, in encoder pre-training, the entire sequence can be observed at once, and so it makes no\nsense to predict any of the tokens in this sequence.\n1.2.2.1 Masked Language Modeling\nOne of the most popular methods of encoder pre-training is masked language modeling , which\nforms the basis of the well-known BERT model [ Devlin et al. ,2019 ]. The idea of masked lan-\nguage modeling is to create prediction challenges by maskin g out some of the tokens in the input\nsequence and training a model to predict the masked tokens. I n this sense, the conventional lan-\nguage modeling problem, which is sometimes called causal language modeling , is a special case\nof masked language modeling: at each position, we mask the to kens in the right-context, and pre-\ndict the token at this position using its left context. Howev er, in causal language modeling we\nonly make use of the left-context in word prediction, while t he prediction may depend on tokens\nin the right-context. By contrast, in masked language model ing, all the unmasked tokens are used\nfor word prediction, leading to a bidirectional model that m akes predictions based on both left and\nright-contexts.\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n\n10 Pre-training\nMore formally, for an input sequence x=x0...xm, suppose that we mask the tokens at po-\nsitions A(x) = {i1,...,i u}. Hence we obtain a masked token sequence ¯xwhere the token at\neach position in A(x)is replaced with a special symbol [MASK] . For example, for the following\nsequence\nThe early bird catches the worm\nwe may have a masked token sequence like this\nThe[MASK] bird catches the [MASK]\nwhere we mask the tokens early andworm (i.e.,i1= 2andi2= 6).\nNow we have two sequences xand¯x. The model is then optimized so that we can correctly\npredict xbased on ¯x. This can be thought of as an autoencoding-like process, and the train-\ning objective is to maximize the reconstruction probabilit yPr(x|¯x). Note that there is a simple\nposition-wise alignment between xand¯x. Because an unmasked token in ¯xis the same as the to-\nken in xat the same position, there is no need to consider the predict ion for this unmasked token.\nThis leads to a simpliﬁed training objective which only maxi mizes the probabilities for masked\ntokens. We can express this objective in a maximum likelihoo d estimation fashion\n(ˆW,ˆθ) = arg max\nW,θ∑\nx∈D∑\ni∈A(x)log PrW,θ\ni(xi|¯x) (1.10)\nor alternatively express it using the cross-entropy loss\n(ˆW,ˆθ) = arg min\nW,θ∑\nx",

This leads to a discrepancy between training an d inference. Moreover, the auto-\nencoding process overlooks the dependencies between maske d tokens. For example, in the above\nexample, the prediction of x2(i.e., the ﬁrst masked token) is made independently of x6(i.e., the\nsecond masked token), though x6should be considered in the context of x2.\nThese issues can be addressed using the permuted language modeling approach to pre-\ntraining [ Yang et al. ,2019 ]. Similar to causal language modeling, permuted language m odeling\ninvolves making sequential predictions of tokens. However , unlike causal modeling where predic-\ntions follow the natural sequence of the text (like left-to- right or right-to-left), permuted language\nmodeling allows for predictions in any order. The approach i s straightforward: we determine an\norder for token predictions and then train the model in a stan dard language modeling manner, as\ndescribed in Section 1.2.1 . Note that in this approach, the actual order of tokens in the text remains\nunchanged, and only the order in which we predict these token s differs from standard language\nmodeling. For example, consider a sequence of 5 tokens x0x1x2x3x4. Let eirepresent the em-\nbedding ofxi(i.e., combination of the token embedding and positional em bedding). In standard\nlanguage modeling, we would generate this sequence in the or der ofx0→x1→x2→x3→x4.\nThe probability of the sequence can be modeled via a generati on process.\nPr(x) = Pr(x0)·Pr(x1|x0)·Pr(x2|x0,x1)·Pr(x3|x0,x1,x2)·\nPr(x4|x0,x1,x2,x3)\n= Pr(x0)·Pr(x1|e0)·Pr(x2|e0,e1)·Pr(x3|e0,e1,e2)·\nPr(x4",

In standard\nlanguage modeling, we would generate this sequence in the or der ofx0→x1→x2→x3→x4.\nThe probability of the sequence can be modeled via a generati on process.\nPr(x) = Pr(x0)·Pr(x1|x0)·Pr(x2|x0,x1)·Pr(x3|x0,x1,x2)·\nPr(x4|x0,x1,x2,x3)\n= Pr(x0)·Pr(x1|e0)·Pr(x2|e0,e1)·Pr(x3|e0,e1,e2)·\nPr(x4|e0,e1,e2,e3) (1.13)\nNow, let us consider a different order for token prediction: x0→x4→x2→x1→x3.

For example, in generating x3, the model considers both its left-context (i.e., e0,e1,e2)\nand right-context (i.e., e4). The embeddings e0,e1,e2,e4incorporate the positional information\nofx0,x1,x2,x4, preserving the original order of the tokens. As a result, th is approach is somewhat\nakin to masked language modeling: we mask out x3and use its surrounding tokens x0,x1,x2,x4\nto predict this token.\nThe implementation of permuted language models is relative ly easy for Transformers. Be-\ncause the self-attention model is insensitive to the order o f inputs, we do not need to explicitly\nreorder the sequence to have a factorization like Eq. ( 1.14). Instead, permutation can be done\nby setting appropriate masks for self-attention. For examp le, consider the case of computing\nPr(x1|e0,e4,e2). We can place x0,x1,x2,x3,x4in order and block the attention from x3tox1\nin self-attention, as illustrated below\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\n12 Pre-training\nx0x1x2x3x4\nMasks for Self-attention:\nBlue box = valid attention\nGray box = blocked attention\nFor a more illustrative example, we compare the self-attent ion masking results of causal language\nmodeling, masked language modeling and permuted language m odeling in Figure 1.3.\n1.2.2.3 Pre-training Encoders as Classiﬁers\nAnother commonly-used idea to train an encoder is to conside r classiﬁcation tasks.

For example, we obtain a positive sample by using actual consecutive\nsentences, and a negative sample by using randomly sampled s entences. Consequently, training\nthis model is the same as training a classiﬁer.

For e xample, Clark et al. [2019 ] in their\nELECTRA model, propose training a Transformer encoder to id entify whether each input token\nis identical to the original input or has been altered in some manner. The ﬁrst step of this method\nis to generate a new sequence from a given sequence of tokens, where some of the tokens are\naltered. To do this, a small masked language model (call it th e generator) is applied: we randomly\nmask some of the tokens, and train this model to predict the ma sked tokens. For each training\nsample, this masked language model outputs a token at each ma sked position, which might be\ndifferent from the original token. At the same time, we train another Transformer encoder (call it\nthe discriminator) to determine whether each predicted tok en is the same as the original token or\naltered. More speciﬁcally, we use the generator to generate a sequence where some of the tokens\nare replaced. Below is an illustration.\noriginal: [CLS] The boy spent hours working on toys .\n↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓\nmasked: [CLS] The boy spent [MASK] working on [MASK] .\n↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓\nGenerator (small masked language model)\n↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓\nreplaced: [CLS] The boy spent decades working on toys .\nThen, we use the discriminator to label each of these tokens a sorginal orreplaced , as follows\nreplaced: [CLS] The boy spent decades working on toys .\n↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓\nDiscriminator (the model we want)\n↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓\nlabel: original original original original replaced original original original original\nFor training, the generator is optimized as a masked languag e model with maximum likelihood\nestimation, and the discriminator is optimized as a classiﬁ er using a classiﬁcation-based loss. In\nELECTRA, the maximum likelihood-based loss and the classiﬁ cation-based loss are combined for\njointly training both the generator and discriminator. An a lternative approach is to use generative\nadversarial networks (GANs), that is, the generator is trai ned to fool the discriminator, and the dis-\ncriminator is trained to distinguish the output of the gener ator from the true distribution. However,\nGAN-style training complicates the training task and is mor e difﬁcult to scale up. Nevertheless,\nonce training is complete, the generator is discarded, and t he encoding part of the discriminator is\napplied as the pre-trained model for downstream tasks.\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n\n1.2 Self-supervised Pre-training Tasks 15\n1.2.3 Encoder-Decoder Pre-training\nIn NLP, encoder-decoder architectures are often used to mod el sequence-to-sequence problems,\nsuch as machine translation and question answering.

Our goal is to generate a text repre-\nsenting the number 0.81, rather than outputting it as a numerical value.\nThe approach described above provides a new framework of uni versal language understanding\nand generation. Both the task instructions and the problem i nputs are provided to the system\nin text form. The system then follows the instructions to com plete the task. This method puts\ndifferent problems together, with the beneﬁt of training a s ingle model that can perform many\ntasks simultaneously.\nIn general, ﬁne-tuning is necessary for adapting the pre-tr ained model to a speciﬁc downstream\ntask. In this process, one can use different ways to instruct the model for the task, such as using a\nshort name of the task as the preﬁx to the actual input sequenc e or providing a detailed description\nof the task. Since the task instructions are expressed in tex t form and involved as part of the input,\nthe general knowledge of instruction can be gained through l earning the language understanding\nmodels in the pre-training phase. This may help enable zero- shot learning. For example, pre-\ntrained models can generalize to address new problems where the task instructions have never\nbeen encountered.\nThere have been several powerful methods of self-supervise d learning for either Transformer\nencoders or decoders. Applying these methods to pre-train e ncoder-decoder models is relatively\nstraightforward. One common choice is to train encoder-dec oder models as language models.

In both methods,\nthe input to the encoder is a corrupted token sequence where s ome tokens are masked and replaced with [MASK] (or\n[M]for short). The decoder predicts these masked tokens, but in different ways. In BERT-style training, the decoder\nonly needs to compute the loss for the masked tokens, while th e remaining tokens in the sequence can be simply treated\nas[MASK] tokens. In denoising autoencoding, the decoder predicts th e sequence of all tokens in an autoregressive\nmanner. As a result, the loss is obtained by accumulating the losses of all these tokens, as in standard language\nmodeling.\nThe idea is that we represent the corrupted sequence as a sequ ence containing placeholder\nslots. The training task is to ﬁll these slots with the correc t tokens using the surrounding context.\nAn advantage of this approach is that the sequences used in tr aining would be shorter, making the\ntraining more efﬁcient. Note that masked language modeling provides a very general framework\nfor training encoder-decoder models. Various settings can be adjusted to have different training\nversions, such as altering the percentage of tokens masked a nd the maximum length of the masked\nspans.\n1.2.3.2 Denoising Training\nIf we view the problem of training encoder-decoder models as a problem of training denoising\nautoencoders, there will typically be many different metho ds for introducing input corruption and\nreconstructing the input.

The tokens in the input sequence are randomly selecte d and masked.\n•Token Deletion . This method is similar to token masking. However, rather th an replacing\nthe selected tokens with a special symbol [MASK] , these tokens are removed from the\nsequence. See the following example for a comparison of the t oken masking and token\ndeletion methods.\nOriginal ( x): The puppies are frolicking outside the house .\nToken Masking ( xnoise): The puppies are [MASK] outside [MASK] house .\nToken Deletion ( xnoise): The puppies are frolicking outside thehouse .\nwhere the underlined tokens in the original sequence are mas ked or deleted.\n•Span Masking . Non-overlapping spans are randomly sampled over the seque nce. Each\nspan is masked by [MASK] . We also consider spans of length 0, and, in such cases, [MASK]\nis simply inserted at a position in the sequence. For example , we can use span masking to\ncorrupt the above sequence as\nOriginal ( x): The 0 puppies are frolicking outside the house .\nSpan Masking ( xnoise): The [MASK] puppies are [MASK] house .\nHere the span frolicking outside the is replaced with a single [MASK] .0indicates a length-\n0 span, and so we insert an [MASK] between Theandpuppies . Span masking introduces\nnew prediction challenges in which the model needs to know ho w many tokens are gener-\nated from a span. This problem is very similar to fertility mo deling in machine translation\n[Brown et al. ,1993 ].\n\n--- Page 27 ---\n\n20 Pre-training\nIf we consider a sequence consisting of multiple sentences, additional methods of corruption\ncan be applied. In the BART model, there are two such methods.\n•Sentence Reordering . This method randomly permutes the sentences so that the mod el can\nlearn to reorder sentences in a document. Consider, for exam ple, two consecutive sentences\nHard work leads to success . Success brings happiness .\nWe can reorder the two sentences to have a corrupted input seq uence\nSuccess brings happiness . Hard work leads to success .\n•Document Rotation . The goal of this task is to identify the start token of the seq uence.\nFirst, a token is randomly selected from the sequence. Then, the sequence is rotated so that\nthe selected token is the ﬁrst token. For example, suppose we select the token leads from\nthe above sequence. The rotated sequence is\nleads to success . Success brings happiness . Hard work Hard workselected\nwhere the subsequence Hard work before leads is appended to the end of the sequence.\nFor pre-training, we can apply multiple corruption methods to learn robust models, for ex-\nample, we randomly choose one of them for each training sampl e. In practice, the outcome of\nencoder-decoder pre-training depends heavily on the input corruption methods used, and so we\ntypically need to choose appropriate training objectives t hrough careful experimentation.\n1.2.4 Comparison of Pre-training Tasks\nSo far, we have discussed a number of pre-training tasks. Sin ce the same training objective can\napply to different architectures (e.g., using masked langu age modeling for both encoder-only and\nencoder-decoder pre-training), categorizing pre-traini ng tasks based solely on model architecture\ndoes not seem ideal. Instead, we summarize these tasks based on the training",

Hard work Hard workselected\nwhere the subsequence Hard work before leads is appended to the end of the sequence.\nFor pre-training, we can apply multiple corruption methods to learn robust models, for ex-\nample, we randomly choose one of them for each training sampl e. In practice, the outcome of\nencoder-decoder pre-training depends heavily on the input corruption methods used, and so we\ntypically need to choose appropriate training objectives t hrough careful experimentation.\n1.2.4 Comparison of Pre-training Tasks\nSo far, we have discussed a number of pre-training tasks. Sin ce the same training objective can\napply to different architectures (e.g., using masked langu age modeling for both encoder-only and\nencoder-decoder pre-training), categorizing pre-traini ng tasks based solely on model architecture\ndoes not seem ideal. Instead, we summarize these tasks based on the training objectives.\n•Language Modeling . Typically, this approach refers to an auto-regressive gen eration pro-\ncedure of sequences. At one time, it predicts the next token b ased on its previous context.\n•Masked Language Modeling . Masked Language Modeling belongs to a general mask-\npredict framework. It randomly masks tokens in a sequence an d predicts these tokens using\nthe entire masked sequence.\n\n--- Page 28 ---\n\n1.3 Example: BERT 21\n•Permuted Language Modeling . Permuted language modeling follows a similar idea to\nmasked language modeling, but considers the order of (maske d) token prediction. It reorders\nthe input sequence and predicts the tokens sequentially. Ea ch prediction is based on some\ncontext tokens that are randomly selected.\n•Discriminative Training . In discriminative training, supervision signals are crea ted from\nclassiﬁcation tasks. Models for pre-training are integrat ed into classiﬁers and trained to-\ngether with the remaining parts of the classiﬁers to enhance their classiﬁcation performance.\n•Denoising Autoencoding . This approach is applied to the pre-training of encoder-de coder\nmodels. The input is a corrupted sequence and the encoder-de coder models are trained to\nreconstruct the original sequence.\nTable 1.1illustrates these methods and their variants using example s. The use of these ex-\namples does not distinguish between models, but we mark the m odel architectures where the\npre-training tasks can be applied. In each example, the inpu t consists of a token sequence, and the\noutput is either a token sequence or some probabilities. For generation tasks, such as language\nmodeling, superscripts are used to indicate the generation order on the target side. If the super-\nscripts are omitted, it indicates that the output sequence c an be generated either autoregressively\nor simultaneously. On the source side, we assume that the seq uence undergoes a standard Trans-\nformer encoding process, meaning that each token can see the entire sequence in self-attention.\nThe only exception is in permuted language modeling, where a n autoregressive generation pro-\ncess is implemented by setting attention masks on the encode r side. To simplify the discussion,\nwe remove the token ⟨s⟩from the target-side of each example.\nWhile these pre-training tasks are different, it is possibl e to compare them in the same frame-\nwork and experimental setup [ Dong et al. ,2019 ;Raffel et al. ,2020 ;Lewis et al. ,2020 ]. Note that\nwe cannot list all the pre-training tasks here as there are ma ny of them. For more discussions on\npre-training tasks, the interested reader may refer to some surveys on this topic [ Qiu et al. ,2020 ;\nHan et al. ,2021 ].\n1.3 Example: BERT\nIn this section, we introduce BERT models, which are among th e most popular and widely used\npre-trained sequence encoding models in NLP.\n1.3.1 The Standard Model\nThe standard BERT model, which is proposed in Devlin et al.

The segment embedding ( eseg) is a new type of embedding that indicates whether a token\nbelongs to Sent AorSent B. This can be illustrated by the following example.\nToken [CLS] It is raining .

A Transformer layer\nconsists of a self-attention sub-layer and an FFN sub-layer . Both of them follow the post-norm\narchitecture: output = LNorm( F(input) + input) , whereF(·)is the core function of the sub-\nlayer (either a self-attention model or an FFN), and LNorm( ·)is the layer normalization unit.\nTypically, a number of Transformer layers are stacked to for m a deep network. At each position of\nthe sequence, the output representation is a real-valued ve ctor which is produced by the last layer\nof the network.\nThere are several aspects one may consider in developing BER T models.\n•Vocabulary Size (|V|). In Transformers, each input token is represented as an ent ry in a\nvocabularyV. Large vocabularies can cover more surface form variants of words, but may\nlead to increased storage requirements.\n•Embedding Size (de). Every token is represented as a de-dimensional real-valued vector.\nAs presented above, this vector is the sum of the token embedd ing, positional embedding,\nand segment embedding, all of which are also de-dimensional real-valued vectors.\n•Hidden Size (d).

However, sc aling up BERT and various other\npre-trained models introduces new challenges in training, for example, training very large models\noften becomes unstable and difﬁcult to converge. This makes the problem more complicated, and\nrequires careful consideration of various aspects, includ ing model architecture, parallel computa-\ntion, parameter initialization, and so on. In another examp le,Shoeybi et al. [2019 ] successfully\ntrained a 3.9 billion-parameter BERT-like model, where hun dreds of GPUs were used to manage\nthe increased computational demands.\n1.3.3 More Efﬁcient Models\nCompared to its predecessors, BERT is a relatively large mod el for the time it was proposed.\nThis increase in model size results in larger memory require ments and a consequent slowdown in\nsystem performance. Developing smaller and faster BERT mod els is part of the broader challenge\nof building efﬁcient Transformers, which has been extensiv ely discussed in Tay et al. [2020 ]’s\nwork and Xiao and Zhu [2023 ]’s work. However, a deeper discussion of this general topic is\nbeyond the scope of our current discussion. Here we instead c onsider a few efﬁcient variants of\nBERT.\nSeveral threads of research are of interest to NLP researche rs in developing efﬁcient BERT\nmodels. First, work on knowledge distillation, such as trai ning student models with the output\nof well-trained teacher models, shows that smaller BERT mod els can be obtained by transferring\nknowledge from larger BERT models. Given that BERT models ar e multi-layer networks with\nseveral different types of layers, knowledge distillation can be applied at different levels of repre-\nsentation. For example, beyond distilling knowledge from t he output layers, it is also possible to\nincorporate training loss that measures the difference in o utput of hidden layers between teacher\nmodels and student models [ Sun et al. ,2020 ;Jiao et al. ,2020 ]. Indeed, knowledge distillation has\nbeen one of the most widely-used techniques for learning sma ll pre-trained models.\nSecond, conventional model compression methods can be dire ctly applied to compress BERT\nmodels. One common approach is to use general-purpose pruni ng methods to prune the Trans-\nformer encoding networks [ Gale et al. ,2019 ]. This generally involves removing entire layers\n\n--- Page 35 ---\n\n28 Pre-training\n[Fan et al. ,2019 ] or a certain percentage of parameters in the networks [ Sanh et al. ,2020 ;Chen et al. ,\n2020 ]. Pruning is also applicable to multi-head attention model s. For example, Michel et al.\n[2019 ] show that removing some of the heads does not signiﬁcantly d ecrease the performance\nof BERT models, but speeds up the inference of these models. A nother approach to compress-\ning BERT models is quantization [ Shen et al. ,2020 ]. By representing model parameters as low-\nprecision numbers, the models can be greatly compressed. Wh ile this method is not speciﬁc to\nBERT models, it proves effective for large Transformer-bas ed architectures.\nThird, considering that BERT models are relatively deep and large networks, another thread\nof research uses dynamic networks to adapt these models for e fﬁcient inference.

Wh ile this method is not speciﬁc to\nBERT models, it proves effective for large Transformer-bas ed architectures.\nThird, considering that BERT models are relatively deep and large networks, another thread\nof research uses dynamic networks to adapt these models for e fﬁcient inference. An idea in this\nparadigm is to dynamically choose the layers for processing a token, for example, in depth-\nadaptive models we exit at some optimal depth and thus skip th e rest of the layers in the layer\nstack [ Xin et al. ,2020 ;Zhou et al. ,2020 ]. Similarly, we can develop length-adaptive models in\nwhich the length of the input sequence is dynamically adjust ed. For example, we can skip some of\nthe tokens in the input sequence so that the model can reduce c omputational load on less important\ntokens, enhancing overall efﬁciency.\nFourth, it is also possible to share parameters across layer s to reduce the size of BERT models.\nA simple way to do this is to share the parameters of a whole Tra nsformer layer across the layer\nstack [ Dehghani et al. ,2018 ;Lan et al. ,2020 ]. In addition to the reduced number of parameters,\nthis enables reuse of the same layer in a multi-layer Transfo rmer network, leading to savings of\nmemory footprint at test time.\n1.3.4 Multi-lingual Models\nThe initial BERT model was primarily focused on English. Soo n after this model was proposed,\nit was extended to many languages. One simple way to do this is to develop a separate model\nfor each language. Another approach, which has become more p opular in recent work on large\nlanguage models, is to train multi-lingual models directly on data from all the languages. In\nresponse, multi-lingual BERT (mBERT ) models were developed by training them on text from\n104 languages6. The primary difference from monolingual BERT models is tha t mBERT models\nuse larger vocabularies to cover tokens from multiple langu ages. As a result, the representations\nof tokens from different languages are mapped into the same s pace, allowing for the sharing of\nknowledge across languages via this universal representat ion model.\nOne important application of multi-lingual pre-trained mo dels is cross-lingual learning. In the\ncross-lingual setting, we learn a model on tasks in one langu age, and apply it to the same tasks\nin another language. In cross-lingual text classiﬁcation, for example, we ﬁne-tune a multi-lingual\npre-trained model on English annotated documents. Then, we use the ﬁne-tuned model to classify\nChinese documents.\nAn improvement to multi-lingual pre-trained models like mB ERT is to introduce bilingual data\ninto pre-training. Rather than training solely on monoling ual data from multiple languages, bilin-\ngual training explicitly models the relationship between t okens in two languages. The resulting\nmodel will have innate cross-lingual transfer abilities, a nd thus can be easily adapted to different\nlanguages. Lample and Conneau [2019 ] propose an approach to pre-training cross-lingual lan-\nguage models (XLMs ). In their work, a cross-lingual language model can be train ed in either the\ncausal language modeling or masked language modeling manne r. For masked language modeling\n6https://github.com/google-research/bert/\n\n--- Page 36 ---\n\n1.3 Example: BERT 29\npre-training, the model is treated as an encoder. The traini ng objective is the same as BERT: we\nmaximize the probabilities of some randomly selected token s which are either masked, replaced\nwith random tokens, or kept unchanged in the input. If we cons ider bilingual data in pre-training,\nwe sample a pair of aligned sentences each time. Then, the two sentences are packed together to\nform a single sequence used for training.

For example, consi der an English-Chinese sentence pair\n鲸鱼是哺乳动物。↔Whales are mammals .\nWe can pack them to obtain a sequence, like this\n[CLS]鲸鱼是哺乳动物。[SEP] Whales are mammals . [SEP]\nWe then select a certain percentage of the tokens and replace them with [MASK] .\n[CLS] [MASK]是[MASK]动物。[SEP] Whales [MASK] [MASK] .[SEP]\nThe goal of pre-training is to maximize the product of the pro babilities of the masked tokens given\nthe above sequence. By performing training in this way, the m odel can learn to represent both the\nEnglish and Chinese sequences, as well as to capture the corr espondences between tokens in the\ntwo languages. For example, predicting the Chinese token 鲸鱼 may require the information\nfrom the English token Whales . Aligning the representations of the two languages essenti ally\ntransforms the model into a “translation” model. So this tra ining objective is also called transla-\ntion language modeling . Figure 1.7shows an illustration of this approach.\nA beneﬁt of multi-lingual pre-trained models is their inher ent capability of handling code-\nswitching. In NLP and linguistics, code-switching refers t o switching among languages in a text.\nFor example, the following is a mixed language text containi ng both Chinese and English:\n周末我们打算去做hiking，你想一起来吗？\n(We plan to go hiking this weekend, would you like to join us?)\nFor multi-lingual pre-trained models, we do not need to iden tify whether a token is Chinese or\nEnglish. Instead, every token is just an entry of the shared v ocabulary. This can be imagined as\ncreating a “new” language that encompasses all the language s we want to process.\nThe result of multi-lingual pre-training is inﬂuenced by se veral factors. Given that the model\narchitecture is ﬁxed, one needs to specify the size of the sha red vocabulary, the number (or per-\ncentage) of samples in each language, the size of the model, a nd so on. Conneau et al. [2020 ]\npoint out several interesting issues regarding large-scal e multi-lingual pre-training for XLM-like\nmodels. First, as the number of supported languages increas es, a larger model is needed to handle\nthese languages. Second, a larger shared vocabulary is help ful for modeling the increased diver-\nsity in languages. Third, low-resource languages more easi ly beneﬁt from cross-lingual transfer\nfrom high-resource languages, particularly when similar h igh-resource languages are involved in\npre-training. However, interference may occur if the model is trained for an extended period,\n\n--- Page 37 ---\n\n30 Pre-training\n[CLS] [MASK]是[MASK]动物。 [SEP] Whales [MASK] [MASK] .[SEP]\n(zh) (zh) (zh) (zh) (zh) (zh) (zh) (en) (en) (en) (en) (en)e0 e1 e2 e3 e4 e5 e6 e7 e8 e9 e10 e11h0 h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 h7 h8 h9 h10 h11鲸鱼哺乳 are mammals\nTransformer Encoder\nFig. 1.7: An illustration of translation language modeling.

For ease of understanding, we present a simple example\nwhere all the selected tokens are masked. The model is traine d to predict these masked tokens. As the sequence\ncontains tokens in two languages, predicting a token in one l anguage allows access to tokens in the other language,\nthereby enabling cross-lingual modeling. In Lample and Conneau [2019 ]’s work, an input embedding (i.e., ei) is the\nsum of the token embedding, positional embedding, and langu age embedding. This requires that each token is assigned\nwith a language label. Thus we can distinguish tokens in diff erent languages. In multi-lingual pre-training, particul arly\nin work using shared vocabularies, specifying the language to which a token belongs is not necessary. The use of\nlanguage embeddings in turn makes it difﬁcult to handle code -switching. Therefore, we assume here that all token\nrepresentations are language-independent.\nmeaning the overall performance of the pre-trained model st arts decreasing at a certain point dur-\ning pre-training. Thus, in practical systems, one may need t o stop the pre-training early to prevent\ninterference.\n1.4 Applying BERT Models\nOnce a BERT model is pre-trained, it can then be used to solve N LP problems. But BERT models\nare not immediately ready for performing speciﬁc downstrea m tasks. In general, additional ﬁne-\ntuning work is required to make them adapt. As a ﬁrst step, we n eed a predictor to align the\noutput of the model with the problem of interest. Let BERT ˆθ(·)be a BERT model with pre-\ntrained parameters ˆθ, and Predict ω(·)be a prediction network with parameters ω. By integrating\nthe prediction network with the output of the BERT model, we d evelop a model to tackle the\ndownstream tasks. This model can be expressed as\ny= Predict ω(BERT ˆθ(x)) (1.21)\nwhere xis the input and yis the output that ﬁts the problem. For example, in classiﬁca tion\nproblems, the model outputs a probability distribution ove r labels.\nThen, we collect a set of labeled samples D, and ﬁne-tune the model by\n(˜ω,˜θ) = arg min\nω,ˆθ+∑\n(x,ygold)∈DLoss( yω,ˆθ+,ygold) (1.22)\n\n--- Page 38 ---\n\n1.4 Applying BERT Models 31\nwhere (x,ygold)represents a tuple of an input and its corresponding output. The notation of this\nequation seems a bit complicated, but the training/tuning p rocess is standard. We optimize the\nmodel by minimizing the loss over the tuning samples. The out come is the optimized parameters\n˜ωand˜θ. The optimization starts with the pre-trained parameters ˆθ. Here we use ˆθ+to indicate that\nthe parameters are initialized with ˆθ, and use yω,ˆθ+to denote the model output computed using\nthe parameters ωandˆθ+.\nWith the ﬁne-tuned parameters ˜ωand˜θ, we can apply the model Predict ˜ω(BERT ˜θ(·))to new\ndata of the same tasks for which the model was ﬁne-tuned. The f orm of the downstream tasks\ndetermines the input and output formats of the model, as well as the architecture of the prediction\nnetwork.

Many NLP pr oblems can be categorized\nas text classiﬁcation tasks, and there have been several tex t classiﬁcation benchmarks for\nevaluating pre-trained models. For example, we can classif y texts by their grammatical cor-\nrectness (grammaticality) or emotional tone (sentiment) [ Socher et al. ,2013 ;Warstadt et al. ,\n2019 ]. Note that the prediction network could be any classiﬁcati on model, such as a deep\nneural network or a more traditional classiﬁcation model. T he entire model can then be\ntrained or ﬁne-tuned in the manner of a standard classiﬁcati on model. For example, the pre-\ndiction network can be simply a Softmax layer and the model pa rameters can be optimized\nby maximizing the probabilities of the correct labels.\n•Classiﬁcation (Pair of Texts). Classiﬁcation can also be performed on a pai r of texts. Sup-\npose we have two texts, x1...xmandy1...yn. We can concatenate these texts to form a single\nsequence with a length len.

Another exampl e is named entity recognition\n(NER) in which we label each word with an NER tag, and named ent ities are identiﬁed\nusing these tags.

Following Seo et al. [2017 ], we add\ntwo networks on top of the BERT output for yj: one for generating the probability of yj\nbeing the beginning of the span (denoted by pbeg\nj), and one for generating the probability\nofyjbeing the ending of the span (denoted by pend\nj).

While our focus in this section has been primarily\non language understanding problems, it is worth noting that BERT models can be applied\nto a broader range of NLP tasks. In fact, BERT models can be use d in all the scenarios\nwhere we need to encode a piece of text. One application that w e have not mentioned is\ntext generation which includes a range of tasks such as machi ne translation, summarization,\nquestion answering, and dialogue generation. These tasks c an be formulated as sequence-\nto-sequence problems: we use an encoder to represent the sou rce text, and a decoder to\ngenerate the corresponding target text. A straightforward method to apply BERT models\nis to consider them as encoders. Before ﬁne-tuning, we can in itialize the parameters of the\nencoder with those from a pre-trained BERT model. Then, the e ncoder-decoder model can\nbe ﬁne-tuned on pairs of texts as usual. The following shows t he architecture of a neural\nmachine translation system where a BERT model is applied on t he source side.\n[CLS]x1...xm[SEP]\nSource Textex\ncls ex\n1... ex\nmex\nm+1BERT (Encoder)Adapter\n⟨s⟩y1y2...yn−1ey\n0 ey\n1 ey\n2... ey\nn−1Decodery1y2y3...ynTarget Text\nHerex1...xmdenotes the source sequence, y1...yndenotes the target sequence, ex\n1...ex\nm\ndenotes the embedding sequence of x1...xm, and ey\n1...ey\nndenotes the embedding sequence\nofy1...yn.

In particular, we have dis-\ncussed self-supervised pre-training and its application t o encode-only, decoder-only, and encoder-\ndecoder architectures. Moreover, we have presented and com pared a variety of pre-training tasks\nfor these architectures. As an example, BERT is used to illus trate how sequence models are pre-\ntrained via masked language modeling and applied to differe nt downstream tasks.\nRecent years have shown remarkable progress in NLP, led by th e large-scale use of self-\nsupervised pre-training. And sweeping advances are being m ade across many tasks, not only\nin NLP but also in computer vision and other areas of AI. One id ea behind these advances is that a\nsigniﬁcant amount of knowledge about the world can be learne d by simply training these AI sys-\ntems on huge amounts of unlabeled data. For example, a langua ge model can learn some general\nknowledge of a language by repeatedly predicting masked wor ds in large-scale text. As a result,\nthis pre-trained language model can serve as a foundation mo del, which can be easily adapted to\naddress speciﬁc downstream NLP tasks. This paradigm shift i n NLP has enabled the development\nof incredibly powerful systems for language understanding , generation, and reasoning [ Manning ,\n2022 ]. However, it is important to recognize that we are still in t he early stages of creating truly in-\ntelligent systems, and there is a long way to go. Nevertheles s, large-scale pre-training has opened\na door to intelligent systems that researchers have long asp ired to develop, though several key re-\nsearch areas remain open for exploration, such as learning i ntelligence efﬁciently using reasonably\nsmall-sized data and acquiring complex reasoning and plann ing abilities.\nNote that this chapter is mostly introductory and cannot cov er all aspects of pre-training. For\nexample, there are many methods to ﬁne-tune a pre-trained mo del, offering different ways to better\nadapt the model to diverse situations. Moreover, large lang uage models, which are considered one\nof the most signiﬁcant achievements in AI in recent years, ar e skipped in this section. We leave\nthe discussion of these topics to the following chapters.\n\n--- Page 43 ---\n\nCHAPTER 2\nGenerative Models\nOne of the most signiﬁcant advances in NLP in recent years mig ht be the development of large\nlanguage models (LLMs). This has helped create systems that can understand and generate nat-\nural languages like humans.

With these achi evements, NLP made big strides\nand entered a new era of research in which difﬁcult problems a re being solved, such as building\nconversational systems that can communicate with humans sm oothly.\nThe concept of language modeling or probabilistic language modeling dates back to early ex-\nperiments conducted by Shannon [1951 ].

Although Shannon’s experiments were preliminary, the fun damental\ngoals and methods of language modeling have remained largel y unchanged over the decades since\nthen. For quite a long period, particularly before 2010, the dominant approach to language mod-\neling was the n-gram approach [ Jurafsky and Martin ,2008 ]. Inn-gram language modeling, we\nestimate the probability of a word given its preceding n−1words, and thus the probability of a\nsequence can be approximated by the product of a series of n-gram probabilities. These proba-\nbilities are typically estimated by collecting smoothed re lative counts of n-grams in text. While\nsuch an approach is straightforward and simple, it has been e xtensively used in NLP. For example,\nthe success of modern statistical speech recognition and ma chine translation systems has largely\ndepended on the utilization of n-gram language models [ Jelinek ,1998 ;Koehn ,2010 ].\nApplying neural networks to language modeling has long been attractive, but a real break-\nthrough appeared as deep learning techniques advanced. A wi dely cited study is Bengio et al.\n[2003 ]’s work where n-gram probabilities are modeled via a feed-forward network and learned\nby training the network in an end-to-end fashion. A by-produ ct of this neural language model\nis the distributed representations of words, known as word e mbeddings. Rather than represent-\ning words as discrete variables, word embeddings map words i nto low-dimensional real-valued\nvectors, making it possible to compute the meanings of words and wordn-grams in a continu-\nous representation space. As a result, language models are n o longer burdened with the curse of\ndimensionality, but can represent exponentially many n-grams via a compact and dense neural\nmodel.\nThe idea of learning word representations through neural la nguage models inspired subsequent\nresearch in representation learning in NLP. However, this a pproach did not attract signiﬁcant in-\nterest in developing NLP systems in the ﬁrst few years after i ts proposal. Starting in about 2012,\nthough, advances were made in learning word embeddings from large-scale text via simple word\nprediction tasks. Several methods, such as Word2Vec, were p roposed to effectively learn such\nembeddings, which were then successfully applied in a varie ty of NLP systems [ Mikolov et al. ,\n2013a ;b]. As a result of these advances, researchers began to think o f learning representations of\nsequences using more powerful language models, such as LSTM -based models [ Sutskever et al. ,\n2014 ;Peters et al. ,2018 ]. And further progress and interest in sequence representa tion exploded\nafter Transformer was proposed. Alongside the rise of Trans former, the concept of language mod-\neling was generalized to encompass models that learn to pred ict words in various ways.

We begin by giving a general introduction\nto LLMs, including the key steps of building such models. We t hen discuss two scaling issues of\nLLMs: how LLMs are trained at scale, and how LLMs can be improv ed to handle very long texts.\nFinally, we give a summary of these discussions.\n2.1 A Brief Introduction to LLMs\nIn this section we give an introduction to the basic ideas of L LMs as required for the rest of this\nchapter and the following chapters. We will use terms word andtoken interchangeably. Both\nof them refer to the basic units used in language modeling, th ough their original meanings are\ndifferent.\nBefore presenting details, let us ﬁrst consider how languag e models work. The goal of lan-\nguage modeling is to predict the probability of a sequence of tokens occurring. Let {x0,x1,...,x m}\nbe a sequence of tokens, where x0is the start symbol ⟨s⟩(or⟨SOS⟩)1. The probability of this se-\nquence can be deﬁned using the chain rule\nPr(x0,...,x m) = Pr(x0)·Pr(x1|x0)·Pr(x2|x0,x1)· · ·Pr(xm|x0,...,x m−1)\n=m∏\ni=0Pr(xi|x0,...,x i−1) (2.1)\nor alternatively in a logarithmic form\nlog Pr(x0,...,x m) =m∑\ni=0log Pr(xi|x0,...,x i−1) (2.2)\nHere Pr(xi|x0,...,x i−1)is the probability of the token xigiven all its previous tokens {x0,...,x i−1}\n2. In the era of deep learning, a typical approach to language m odeling is to estimate this\n1The start symbol can also be [CLS] following BERT models.\n2We assume that when i= 0 ,Pr(xi|x0,...,x i−1) = Pr(x0) = 1 .

The probability Pr(xi|x0,...,x i−1)is the value of the i-th entry of\nPr(·|x0,...,x i−1).\nWhen applying a trained language model, a common task is to ﬁn d the most likely token given\nits previous context tokens. This token prediction task can be described as\nˆxi= arg max\nxi∈VPr(xi|x0,...,x i−1) (2.3)\nWe can perform word prediction multiple times to generate a c ontinuous text: each time we\npredict the best token ˆxi, and then add this predicted token to the context for predict ing the next\ntoken ˆxi+1. This results in a left-to-right generation process implem enting Eqs. ( 2.1) and ( 2.2). To\nillustrate, consider the generation of the following three words given the preﬁx ‘ ⟨s⟩a’, as shown\nin Table 2.1. Now we discuss how LLMs are constructed, trained, and appli ed.\n2.1.1 Decoder-only Transformers\nAs is standard practice, the input of a language model is a seq uence of tokens (denoted by\n{x0,...,x m−1}). For each step, an output token is generated, shifting the s equence one po-\nsition forward for the next prediction. To do this, the langu age model outputs a distribution\nPr(·|x0,...,x i−1)at each position i, and the token xiis selected according to this distribution.\nThis model is trained by maximizing the log likelihood∑m\ni=1log Pr(xi|x0,...,x i−1)3.\nHere, we focus on the decoder-only Transformer architectur e, as it is one of the most popular\nmodel architectures used in LLMs. The input sequence of toke ns is represented by a sequence\nofde-dimensional vectors {e0,...,em−1}.eiis the sum of the token embedding of xiand the\npositional embedding of i. The major body of the model is a stack of Transformer blocks ( or\nlayers). Each Transformer block has two stacked sub-layers , one for self-attention modeling and\none for FFN modeling. These sub-layers can be deﬁned using th e post-norm architecture\noutput = LNorm( F(input) + input) (2.4)\n3Note that∑m\ni=1log Pr(xi|x0,...,x i−1) =∑m\ni=0log Pr(xi|x0,...,x i−1)since log Pr(x0) = 0 .\n\n--- Page 46 ---\n\n2.1 A Brief Introduction to LLMs 39\nor the pre-norm architecture\noutput = LNorm( F(input)) + input (2.5)\nwhere input andoutput denote the input and output, both being an m×dmatrix.

These suc-\ncesses have led NLP researchers to continue increasing both the training data and model size in\norder to build more powerful language models.\nHowever, as language models become larger, we confront new t raining challenges, which\nsigniﬁcantly change the problem compared to training relat ively small models. One of these\nchallenges arises from the need for large-scale distribute d systems to manage the data, model\nparameters, training routines, and so on. Developing and ma intaining such systems requires a\nsigniﬁcant amount of work in both software and hardware engi neering, as well as expertise in deep\nlearning. A related issue is that when the training is scaled up, we need more computing resources\nto ensure the training process can be completed in an accepta ble time. For example, it generally\nrequires hundreds or thousands of GPUs to train an LLM with te ns of billions of parameters\nfrom scratch. This requirement drastically increases the c ost of training such models, especially\nconsidering that many training runs are needed as these mode ls are developed. Also, from the\nperspective of deep learning, the training process can beco me unstable if the neural networks are\nvery deep and/or the model size is very large. In response, we typically need to modify the model\narchitecture to adapt LLMs to large-scale training. In Sect ion2.2we will present more discussions\non these issues.\n\n--- Page 49 ---\n\n42 Generative Models\n2.1.3 Fine-tuning LLMs\nOnce we have pre-trained an LLM, we can then apply it to perfor m various NLP tasks. Tradi-\ntionally language models are used as components of other sys tems, for example, they are widely\napplied to score translations in statistical machine trans lation systems. By contrast, in generative\nAI, LLMs are considered complete systems and are employed to address NLP problems by mak-\ning use of their generation nature. A common approach is to de scribe the task we want to address\nin text and then prompt LLMs to generate text based on this des cription. This is a standard text\ngeneration task where we continue or complete the text start ing from a given context.\nMore formally, let x=x0...xmdenote a token sequence of context given by users, and\ny=y1...yndenote a token sequence following the context. Then, the inf erence of LLMs can be\ndeﬁned as a problem of ﬁnding the most likely sequence ybased on x:\nˆy= arg max\nylog Pr( y|x)\n= arg max\nyn∑\ni=1log Pr(yi|x0,...,x m,y1,...,y i−1) (2.15)\nHere∑n\ni=1log Pr(yi|x0,...,x m,y1,...,y i−1)essentially expresses the same thing as the right-\nhand side of Eq.

Throughout this chapter and subsequent ones, we will emplo y separate\nvariables xandyto distinguish the input and output of an LLM, though they can be seen as sub-\nsequences from the same sequence. By adopting such notation , we see that the form of the above\nequation closely resembles those used in other text generat ion models in NLP, such as neural\nmachine translation models.\nTo illustrate how LLMs are applied, consider the problem of d etermining the grammaticality\nfor a given sentence.

However, this approach requires\nthat the LLM can recognize and follow the instructions or que stions. One way to do this is to incor-\nporate training samples with instructions and their corres ponding responses into the pre-training\ndataset. While this method is straightforward, building an d training LLMs from scratch is com-\nputationally expensive. Moreover, making instruction-fo llowing data effective for pre-training\nrequires a signiﬁcant amount of such data, but collecting la rge-scale labeled data for all tasks of\ninterest is very difﬁcult.\nA second method, which has been a de facto standard in recent r esearch, is to adapt LLMs\nvia ﬁne-tuning. As such, the token prediction ability learn ed in the pre-training phase can be\ngeneralized to accomplish new tasks. The idea behind ﬁne-tu ning is that some general knowledge\nof language has been acquired in pre-training, but we need a m echanism to activate this knowledge\nfor applying it to new tasks.

Howeve r, these abilities are not fully activated\nuntil we introduce some form of supervision. The general ins truction-following behavior emerges\nas we ﬁne-tune the models with a relatively small amount of la beled data. As a result, we can\nachieve some level of zero-shot learning : the ﬁne-tuned models can handle new tasks that they\nhave not been explicitly trained or ﬁne-tuned for [ Sanh et al. ,2022 ;Wei et al. ,2022a ]. This zero-\nshot learning ability distinguishes generative LLMs from e arlier pre-trained models like BERT,\nwhich are primarily ﬁne-tuned for speciﬁc tasks.\nOnce we have prepared a collection of instruction-describe d data, the ﬁne-tuning process is\nrelatively simple.

We will see more detailed\ndiscussions on this topic in the following chapters.\n2.1.4 Aligning LLMs with the World\nInstruction ﬁne-tuning provides a simple way to adapt LLMs t o tasks that can be well deﬁned. This\nproblem can broadly be categorized as an alignment problem. Here, alignment is referred to as a\nprocess of guiding LLMs to behave in ways that align with huma n intentions. The guidance can\ncome from labeled data, human feedback, or any other form of h uman preferences. For example,\n\n--- Page 54 ---\n\n2.1 A Brief Introduction to LLMs 47\nwe want LLMs not only to be accurate in following instruction s, but also to be unbiased, truthful,\nand harmless. So we need to supervise the models towards huma n values and expectations. A\ncommon example is that when we ask an LLM how to build a weapon, it may provide a list of key\nsteps to do so if it is not carefully aligned. However, a respo nsible model should recognize and\navoid responding to requests for harmful or illegal informa tion. Alignment in this case is crucial\nfor ensuring that LLMs act responsibly and in accordance wit h ethical guidelines.\nA related concept to alignment is AI safety. One ultimate goa l of AI is to build intelligent\nsystems that are safe and socially beneﬁcial. To achieve thi s goal we should keep these systems\nrobust, secure, and subjective, in any conditions of real-w orld use, even in conditions of misuse\nor adverse use. For LLMs, the safety can be increased by align ing them with appropriate human\nguidance, such as human labeled data and interactions with u sers during application.\nAlignment is difﬁcult as human values and expectations are d iverse and shifting. Sometimes,\nit is hard to describe precisely what humans want, unless we s ee the response of LLMs to user\nrequests. This makes alignment no longer a problem of tuning LLMs on predeﬁned tasks, but a\nbigger problem of training them with the interactions with t he real world.\nAs a result of the concerns with controlling AI systems, ther e has been a surge in research\non the alignment issue for LLMs. Typically, two alignment st eps are adopted after LLMs are\npre-trained on large-scale unlabeled data.\n•Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT). This involves continuing the training of pre-trained LLM s\non new, task-oriented, labelled data. A commonly used SFT te chnique is instruction ﬁne-\ntuning. As described in the previous subsection, by learnin g from instruction-response\nannotated data, LLMs can align with the intended behaviors f or following instructions,\nthereby becoming capable of performing various instructio n-described tasks. Supervised\nﬁne-tuning can be seen as following the pre-training + ﬁne-t uning paradigm, and offers a\nrelatively straightforward method to adapt LLMs.\n•Learning from Human Feedback . After an LLM ﬁnishes pre-training and supervised ﬁne-\ntuning, it can be used to respond to user requests if appropri ately prompted. But this model\nmay generate content that is unfactual, biased, or harmful. To make the LLM more aligned\nwith the users, one simple approach is to directly learn from human feedback. For example,\ngiven some instructions and inputs provided by the users, ex perts are asked to evaluate how\nwell the model responds in accordance with their preference s and interests. This feedback\nis then used to further train the LLM for better alignment.\nA typical method for learning from human feedback is to consi der it as a reinforcement learn-\ning (RL) problem, known as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF ) [Ouy",

This feedback\nis then used to further train the LLM for better alignment.\nA typical method for learning from human feedback is to consi der it as a reinforcement learn-\ning (RL) problem, known as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF ) [Ouyang et al. ,\n2022 ]. The RLHF method was initially proposed to address general sequential decision-making\nproblems [ Christiano et al. ,2017 ], and was later successfully employed in the development of\nthe GPT series models [ Stiennon et al. ,2020 ]. As a reinforcement learning approach, the goal of\nRLHF is to learn a policy by maximizing some reward from the en vironment. Speciﬁcally, two\ncomponents are built in RLHF:\n•Agent . An agent, also called an LM agent, is the LLM that we want to tr ain. This agent\noperates by interacting with its environment: it receives a text from the environment and\n\n--- Page 55 ---\n\n48 Generative Models\noutputs another text that is sent back to the environment. Th e policy of the agent is the\nfunction deﬁned by the LLM, that is, Pr(y|x).\n•Reward Model . A reward model is a proxy of the environment. Each time the ag ent\nproduces an output sequence, the reward model assigns this o utput sequence a numerical\nscore (i.e., the reward). This score tells the agent how good the output sequence is.\nIn RLHF, we need to perform two learning tasks: 1) reward mode l learning, which involves\ntraining a reward model using human feedback on the output of the agent, and 2) policy learning,\nwhich involves optimizing a policy guided by the reward mode l using reinforcement learning\nalgorithms. Here is a brief outline of the key steps involved in RLHF.\n• Build an initial policy using pre-training and instructio n ﬁne-tuning.\n• Use the policy to generate multiple outputs for each input, and then collect human feedback\non these outputs (e.g., comparisons of the outputs).\n• Learn a reward model from the human feedback.\n• Fine-tune the policy with the supervision from the reward m odel.\nFigure 2.2shows an overview of RLHF. Given that this section serves onl y as a brief intro-\nduction to concepts of LLMs, a detailed discussion of RLHF te chniques will not be included. We\ninstead illustrate the basic ideas behind RLHF using a simpl e example.\nSuppose we have trained an LLM via pre-training and instruct ion ﬁne-tuning. This LLM is\ndeployed to respond to requests from users. For example, a us er may input\nHow can I live a more environmentally friendly life?\nWe use the LLM to generate 4 different outputs (denoted by {y1,...,y4}) by sampling the\noutput space\nOutput 1 ( y1): Consider switching to an electric vehicle or bicycle inst ead of\ntraditional cars to reduce carbon emissions and protect our planet.\nOutput 2 ( y2): Adopt a minimalist lifestyle.

There are 4 key steps involved: a) traini ng an initial LLM (i.e., policy) using pre-\ntraining and supervised ﬁne-tuning; b) collecting human pr eference data by ranking the outputs of the LLM; c) training\na reward model using the ranking results; d) RL ﬁne-tuning of the policy based on the reward model. Double line\narrows mean training or ﬁne-tuning.\nWe then ask annotators to evaluate these outputs. One straig htforward way is to assign a rating\nscore to each output. In this case, the reward model learning problem can be framed as a task of\ntraining a regression model. But giving numerical scores to LLM outputs is not an easy task for\nannotators. It is usually difﬁcult to design an annotation s tandard that all annotators can agree on\nand easily follow. An alternative method, which is more popu lar in the development of LLMs, is\nto rank these outputs. For example, a possible ranking of the above outputs is\ny1≻y4≻y2≻y3\n\n--- Page 57 ---\n\n50 Generative Models\nA reward model is then trained using this ranking result. In g eneral, a reward model in RLHF\nis a language model that shares the same architecture as the t arget LLM, but with a smaller model\nsize. Given the input xand output yk, we concatenate them to form a sequence seqk= [x,yk].\nThis sequence is processed from left to right using forced de coding. Since each position can\nonly access its left context in language modeling, the outpu t of the top-most Transformer layer at\nthe ﬁrst position cannot be used as the representation of the sequence. Instead, a special symbol\n(e.g., ⟨\\s⟩) is added to the end of the sequence, and the corresponding ou tput of the Transformer\nlayer stack is considered as the representation of the entir e sequence. An output layer, such as a\nlinear transformation layer, is built on top of this represe ntation to generate the reward, denoted\nbyR(seqk)orR(x,yk).\nWe train this reward model using ranking loss. For example, a pair-wise ranking loss function\ncan be written in the form\nLoss ω(Dr) = −E(x,yk1,yk2)∼D rlog(Sigmoid( Rω(x,yk1)−Rω(x,yk2))) (2.19)\nwhereωrepresents the parameters of the reward model, and Drrepresents a set of tuples of an\ninput and a pair of outputs. (x,yk1,yk2)∼ D ris a sampling operation which draws a sample\n(x,yk1,yk2)from Drwith some probability. As an example, suppose we ﬁrst draw a m odel\ninput xwith a uniform distribution and then draw a pair of model outp uts with a probability of\nyk1≻yk2given x(denoted by Pr(yk1≻yk2|x)). The corresponding loss function is given by\nLoss",

Since this approach requires no additional tra ining or tuning, adapting LLMs becomes\nhighly efﬁcient once they are developed. This somewhat inﬂu ences the paradigms in NLP: we\nno longer need to develop speciﬁc systems for individual tas ks but can instead use a single, well-\ntrained LLM to perform different tasks by prompting it. An ap pealing aspect of LLM prompting\narises as a result: users can easily have “customized” syste ms by designing their own prompts\nfor LLMs. Given the important role played by prompting in LLM s,prompting engineering has\nbecome a very active area of research in NLP.\nThe term prompt is used in many different ways in the literature. In this chap ter, this term\nrefers to the entire input to LLMs, and so we use the terms prompt andmodel input interchange-\nably. Before discussing prompting further, let us ﬁrst see a few examples where the prompts\nare more complex than those presented in the previous subsec tions. Note that this subsection is\nnot aimed at writing high-quality prompts but rather at high lighting some interesting issues in\nprompting LLMs.\nOne of the popular ways to use LLMs is to assign them a “role” pl ayed in generating responses.\nFor example, LLMs can act as a psychologist when answering qu estions.\n\n--- Page 59 ---\n\n52 Generative Models\nPlease explain what delayed gratiﬁcation is?\nNote, you are a researcher with a deep background in psycholo gy.

How can I help you?\nWho won the FIFA World Cup 2022?\nArgentina won the FIFA World Cup 2022.\nWhere was it held?\nThe 2022 FIFA World Cup was held in Qatar.\nHow many times has Argentina won the World Cup?\nArgentina has won the FIFA World Cup three times.\n...\nThese examples and previous ones have shown that appropriat e responses can be generated\nvia prompts involving clear instructions and questions. Ho wever, when problem solving requires\nknowledge that is not explicitly speciﬁed, LLMs may make mis takes, even though the instructions\nare sufﬁciently clear and precise. A family of challenging t asks for LLMs involves arithmetic\nreasoning and commonsense reasoning. For example, we can as k an LLM to solve primary school\nmath problems presented in natural language.\nJack has 7 apples. He ate 2 of them for dinner, but then his mom g ave him 5 more\napples. The next day, Jack gave 3 apples to his friend John. Ho w many apples\ndoes Jack have left in the end?\nThe answer is 10.\nThe correct answer should be 7, so the model output is incorre ct.\nOne approach to addressing such issues is to incorporate lea rning into prompts, called in-\ncontext learning or (ICL). The idea of ICL is to demonstrate the ways to solve problems in\nprompts, and condition predictions on these demonstration s. Here is an example where a similar\nproblem and the corresponding answer are presented in the pr ompt (green = demonstrations).\nTom has 12 marbles. He wins 7 more marbles in a game with his fri end but then\nloses 5 marbles the next day.

The next day, Jack gave 3 apples to his friend John. Ho w many apples\ndoes Jack have left in the end?\nThe answer is 12.\nBut the LLM still made mistakes this time. A reason for this mi ght be that solving math\nproblems does not only involve problem-answer mappings but also, to a larger extent, the under-\nlying logical inference in multiple steps. A method to impro ve the inference abilities of LLMs\nischain-of-thought prompting (COT prompting ) [Wei et al. ,2022c ]. In COT prompting, we\ndecompose complex reasoning problems into multiple proble m-solving intermediate steps.

He loses 5 marbles the next day, bring ing his total down\nto 14 marbles. His brother gifts him 3 more marbles, increasi ng his total to 17\nmarbles. Therefore, Tom now has 17 marbles.

Therefore, Jack\nhas7apples left. Sotheanswer is7.\nThis approach is also called one-shot COT prompting . Likewise, we can add more demon-\nstrations to have a few-shot COT prompting approach.\nFurthermore, a special kind of COT, zero-shot COT , introduces instructions that provoke\nLLMs to think, without presenting any intermediate reasoni ng steps in the prompts [ Kojima et al. ,\n\n--- Page 62 ---\n\n2.1 A Brief Introduction to LLMs 55\n2022 ].

This zero-shot learning ability emerg es as LLMs are pre-trained and/or ﬁne-\ntuned. Also, one-shot and few-shot learning methods are mor e often considered when LLMs do\nnot acquire the corresponding zero-shot learning ability.

More discussions on prompting can\nbe found in Chapter 3.\n2.2 Training at Scale\nAs a ﬁrst step in developing LLMs, we need to train these model s on large amounts of data.\nThe training task is itself standard: the objective is to max imize the likelihood, which can be\nachieved via gradient descent. However, as we scale up both t he model size and the amount\nof data, the problem becomes very challenging, for example, large models generally make the\ntraining unstable. In this section, we discuss several issu es of large-scale training for LLMs,\nincluding data preparation, model modiﬁcation, and distri buted training. We also discuss the\nscaling laws for LLMs, which help us understand their traini ng efﬁciency and effectiveness.\n2.2.1 Data Preparation\nThe importance of data cannot be overstated in NLP. As larger neural networks are developed,\nthe demand for data continues to increase. For example, deve loping LLMs may require trillions\nof tokens in pre-training (see Table 2.3), orders of magnitude larger than those used in training\nconventional NLP models. In general, we may want to gather as much training data as possible.\nHowever, larger training datasets do not mean better traini ng results, and the development of\nLLMs raises new issues in creating or collecting these datas ets.\nA ﬁrst issue is the quality of data. High-quality data has lon g been seen as crucial for training\ndata-driven NLP systems. Directly using raw text from vario us sources is in general undesirable.\nFor example, a signiﬁcant portion of the data used to train re cent LLMs comes from web scraping,\nwhich may contain errors and inappropriate content, such as toxic information and fabricated\nfacts. Also, the internet is ﬂooded with machine-generated content due to the widespread use of\nAI, presenting further challenges for processing and using web-scraped data.

We want the training d ata to cover as many types of\ndata as possible, so that the trained models can adapt to diff erent downstream tasks easily. It has\nbeen widely recognized that the quality and diversity of tra ining data both play very important\nroles in LLMs. An interesting example is that incorporating programming code into training data\nhas been found to be beneﬁcial for LLMs. The beneﬁts are demon strated not only in enhancing the\nprogramming abilities of LLMs, but also in improving reason ing for complex problems, especially\nthose requiring COT prompting. The concept “diversity” can be extended to include language\ndiversity as well. For example, many LLMs are trained on mult i-lingual data, and therefore we\ncan handle multiple languages using a single model. While th is approach shows strong abilities\nin multi-lingual and cross-lingual tasks, its performance on speciﬁc languages largely depends on\nthe volume and quality of the data for those languages. It has been shown in some cases to provide\npoor results for low-resource languages.\nA third issue is the bias in training data.

This can partly be attributed to class imbalance in the training data,\nfor example, the term nurses is more often associated with women.

For example, anonymization tech-\nniques can be applied to remove personally identiﬁable info rmation from training data to prevent\nLLMs from learning from such data. However, in practice, era sing or redacting all sensitive data\nis difﬁcult. Therefore, many LLMs, particularly those laun ched for public service, typically work\nwith systems that can detect the potential exposure of sensi tive data, or are ﬁne-tuned to reject\n\n--- Page 65 ---\n\n58 Generative Models\ncertain requests that could lead to information leakage.\n2.2.2 Model Modiﬁcations\nTraining LLMs is difﬁcult. A commonly encountered problem i s that the training process be-\ncomes more unstable as LLMs get bigger. For example, one need s to choose a small learning rate\nto achieve stable training with gradient descent, but this i n turn results in much longer training\ntimes. Sometimes, even when the training conﬁguration is ca refully designed, training may di-\nverge at certain points during optimization. The training o f LLMs is generally inﬂuenced by many\nfactors, such as parameter initialization, batching, and r egularization. Here, we focus on common\nmodiﬁcations and improvements to the standard Transformer architecture, which are considered\nimportant in developing trainable LLMs.\n2.2.2.1 Layer Normalization with Residual Connections\nLayer normalization is used to stabilize training for deep n eural networks. It is a process of\nsubtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation . By normalizing layer output in\nthis way, we can effectively reduce the covariate shift prob lem and improve the training stability.\nIn Transformers, layer normalization is typically used tog ether with residual connections. As\ndescribed in Section 2.1.1 , a sub-layer can be based on either the post-norm architectu re, in which\nlayer normalization is performed right after a residual blo ck, or the pre-norm architecture, in\nwhich layer normalization is performed inside a residual bl ock. While both of these architectures\nare widely used in Transformer-based systems [ Wang et al. ,2019 ], the pre-norm architecture has\nproven to be especially useful in training deep Transformer s. Given this, most LLMs are based on\nthe pre-norm architecture, expressed as output = LNorm( F(input)) + input .\nA widely-used form of the layer normalization function is gi ven by\nLNorm( h) =α·h−µ\nσ+ǫ+β (2.23)\nwhere his ad-dimensional real-valued vector, µis the mean of all the entries of h, andσis the\ncorresponding standard deviation. ǫis introduced for the sake of numerical stability. α∈Rdand\nβ∈Rdare the gain and bias terms.\nA variant of layer normalization, called root mean square (R MS) layer normalization, only\nre-scales the input vector but does not re-center it [ Zhang and Sennrich ,2019 ]. The RMS layer\nnormalization function is given by\nLNorm( h) =α·h\nσrms+ǫ+β (2.24)\nwhereσrmsis the root mean square of h, that is,σrms= (1\nd∑d\nk",

A standard form of the FFNs used in these sub-layers can\nbe expressed as\nFFN( h) =σ(hW h+bh)Wf+bf (2.25)\nwhere Wh∈Rd×dh,bh∈Rdh,Wf∈Rdh×d, and bf∈Rdare the parameters, and dhis the\nhidden size. σ(·)is the activation function of the hidden layer. A common choi ce forσ(·)is the\nrectiﬁed linear unit (ReLU ), given by\nσrelu(h) = max(0 ,h) (2.26)\nIn practical implementations, increasing dhis helpful and thus it is often set to a larger number\nin LLMs. But a very large hidden size poses challenges for bot h training and deployment. In this\ncase, the design of the activation function plays a relative ly more important role in wide FFNs.\nThere are several alternatives to the ReLU in LLMs. One of the se is the gaussian error linear\nunit (GeLU ) which can be seen as a smoothed version of the ReLU. Rather th an controlling the\noutput by the sign of the input, the GeLU function weights its input by the percentile Pr(h≤h).\nHerehis ad-dimensional vector whose entries are drawn from the standa rd normal distribution\nGaussian(0,1)9. Speciﬁcally, the GeLU function is deﬁned to be\nσgelu(h) = hPr(h≤h)\n=hΦ(h) (2.27)\nwhere Φ(h)is the cumulative distribution function of Gaussian(0,1), which can be implemented\nin convenient ways [ Hendrycks and Gimpel ,2016 ]. The GeLU function has been adopted in\nseveral LLMs, such as BERT, GPT-3, and BLOOM.\nAnother family of activation functions which is popular in L LMs is gated linear unit (GLU )-\nbased functions. The basic form of GLUs is given by\nσglu(h) =σ(hW 1+b1)⊙(W2+b2) (2.28)\nwhere W1∈Rd×d,b1∈Rd,W2∈Rd×d, and b2∈Rdare model parameters. Different choices\nofσ(·)result in different versions of GLU functions. For example, ifσ(·)is deﬁned to be the\nGeLU function, we will have the GeGLU function\nσgeglu(h) =σgelu(hW 1+b1)⊙(W2+b2) (2.29)\nThis activation function has been successfully applied in L LMs like Gemma.\nAs another example, consider σ(·)to be the Swish function σswish(h) =h⊙Sigmoid(ch)\n8Here degeneration refers to the phenomenon in which the rank of a matrix is reduced after some processing.\n9Pr(h≤h)is an informal notation.

For more discussions of\nGLUs, the reader can refer to Shazeer [2020 ]’s work.\n2.2.2.3 Removing Bias Terms\nAnother popular model design is to remove the bias terms in af ﬁne transformations used in LLMs.\nThis treatment can be applied to layer normalization, trans formations of the inputs to QKV atten-\ntion, and FFNs. For example, we can modify Eq. ( 2.25) to obtain an FFN with no bias terms\nFFN( h) =σ(hW h)Wf (2.31)\nChowdhery et al. [2022 ] report that removing bias terms helps improve the training stability\nof LLMs. This method has been used in several recent LLMs, suc h as LLaMA and Gemma.\n2.2.2.4 Other Issues\nMany LLMs also involve modiﬁcations to their positional emb edding models. For example, one\ncan replace sinusoidal positional encodings with rotary po sition embeddings so that the learned\nLLMs can handle long sequences better. These models will be d iscussed in Section 2.3.\nNote that while model modiﬁcations are common in training LL Ms, the stability of training\ncan be improved in many different ways. For example, increas ing the batch size as the training\nproceeds has been found to be useful for some LLMs. In general , achieving stable and efﬁcient\nlarge-scale LLM training requires carefully designed setu ps, including learning schedules, opti-\nmizer choices, training parallelism, mixed precision trai ning, and so on. Some of these issues are\nhighly engineered, and therefore, we typically need a numbe r of training runs to obtain satisfactory\nLLMs.\n2.2.3 Distributed Training\nTraining LLMs requires signiﬁcant amounts of computationa l resources. A common approach to\nimproving training efﬁciency is to use large-scale distrib uted systems. Fortunately, alongside the\nrise of neural networks in AI, deep learning-oriented softw are and hardware have been developed,\nmaking it easier to implement LLMs and perform computations . For example, one can now easily\nﬁne-tune an LLM using deep learning software frameworks and a machine with multiple GPUs.\nHowever, scaling up the training of LLMs is still challengin g, and requires signiﬁcant efforts in\ndeveloping hardware and software systems for stable and efﬁ cient distributed training.\nAn important consideration of distributed training is para llelism. There are several forms\nof parallelism: data parallelism, model parallelism, tens or parallelism, and pipeline parallelism.\nDespite different ways to distribute computations across d evices, these parallelism methods are\nbased on a similar idea: the training problem can be divided i nto smaller tasks that can be ex-\necuted simultaneously. The issue of parallelism in trainin g LLMs has been extensively studied\n\n--- Page 68 ---\n\n2.2 Training at Scale 61\n[Narayanan et al. ,2021 ;Fedus et al. ,2022 ].

Here we sketch the basic concepts.\n•Data Parallelism . This method is one of the most widely used parallelism metho ds for\ntraining neural networks. To illustrate, consider the simp lest case where the standard delta\nrule is used in gradient descent\nθt+1=θt−lr·∂Lθt(Dmini)\n∂θt(2.32)\nwhere the new parameters θt+1is obtained by updating the latest parameters θtwith a small\nsteplrin the direction of the negative loss gradient.∂Lθt(Dmini)\n∂θtis the gradient of the loss\nwith respect to the parameters θt, and is computed on a minibatch of training sample Dmini.\nIn data parallelism, we divide Dmini intoNsmaller batches, denoted by {D1,...,DN}.\nThen, we distribute these batches to Nworkers, each with a corresponding batch. Once\nthe data is distributed, these workers can work at the same ti me. The gradient of the entire\nminibatch is obtained by aggregating the gradients compute d by the workers, like this\n∂Lθt(Dmini)\n∂θt=∂Lθt(D1)\n∂θt\nworker 1+∂Lθt(D2)\n∂θt\nworker 2+· · ·+∂Lθt(DN)\n∂θt\nworker N(2.33)\nIn ideal cases where the workers coordinate well and the comm unication overhead is small,\ndata parallelism can achieve nearly an N-fold speed-up for training.\n•Model Parallelism . Although data parallelism is simple and effective, it requ ires each\nworker to run the entire LLM and perform the complete forward and backward process.\nAs LLMs grow larger, it sometimes becomes unfeasible to load and execute an LLM on a\nsingle device. In this case, we can decouple the LLM into smal ler components and run these\ncomponents on different devices. One simple way to do this is to group consecutive layers\nin the layer stack and assign each group to a worker. The worke rs operate in the order of\nthe layers in the stack, that is, in the forward pass we proces s the input from lower-level to\nupper-level layers, and in the backward pass we propagate th e error gradients from upper-\nlevel to lower-level layers. Consider, for example, a Trans former decoder with Lstacked\nblocks. To distribute the computation load, each block is as signed to a worker. See the\nfollowing illustration for a single run of the forward and ba ckward passes of this model.\nWorkerL BL(↑)BL(↓)\n... ... ...\nWorker 2 B2(↑) B2(↓)\nWorker 1B1(↑) B1(↓)\nHere Bldenotes the computation of block l, and the symbols ↑and↓denote the forward and\nbackward passes, respectively. Note that this parallelism method forces the workers to run\nin sequence, so a worker has to wait for the previous worker to ﬁnish their job. This results\nin the devices being idle for most of the time. In practical sy stems, model parallelism is\ngenerally used together with other parallelism mechanisms to maximize the use of devices.\n\n--- Page 69 ---\n\n62 Generative Models\n•Tensor Parallelism . Parallelism can also be performed in a single computation s tep. A\ncommon example is splitting a large parameter matrix into ch unks, multiplying an input\ntensor with each of these chunks separately, and then concat enating the results of these\nmultiplications to form the output.

For example, consider t he multiplication of the repre-\nsentation h∈Rdwith the parameter matrix Wh∈Rd×dhin an FFN sub-layer (see Eq.\n(2.25)). We can slice the matrix Wh∈Rd×dhvertically to a sequence of Msub-matrices\nWh=[\nW1\nhW2\nh...WM\nh]\n(2.34)\nwhere each sub-matrix Wk\nhhas a shape of d×dh\nM. The multiplication of hwithWhcan be\nexpressed as\nhW h=h[\nW1\nhW2\nh...WM\nh]\n=[\nhW1\nhhW2\nh...hWM\nh]\n(2.35)\nWe can perform matrix multiplications {hW1\nh,hW2\nh,...,hWM\nh}onMdevices separately.\nAs a result, we distribute a large matrix multiplication acr oss multiple devices, each of\nwhich may have relatively small memory. From the perspectiv e of the design of modern\nGPUs, tensor parallelism over GPUs provides a two-level, ti le-based approach to parallel\ncomputing. First, at a higher level, we decompose a matrix mu ltiplication into sub-matrix\nmultiplications that can directly ﬁt into the memory of GPUs . Then, at a lower level, we\nexecute these sub-matrix multiplications on GPUs using til e-based parallel algorithms that\nare speciﬁcally optimized for GPUs.\n•Pipeline Parallelism . Above, in model parallelism, we have described a simple app roach\nto spreading groups of model components across multiple dev ices. But this method is in-\nefﬁcient because only one device is activated at a time durin g processing. Pipeline par-\nallelism addresses this issue by introducing overlaps betw een computations on different\ndevices [ Harlap et al. ,2018 ;Huang et al. ,2019 ]. To do this, a batch of samples is divided\ninto a number of micro-batches, and then these micro-batche s are processed by each worker\nas usual. Once a micro-batch is processed by a worker and pass ed to the next one, the\nfollowing micro-batch immediately occupies the same worke r. In other words, we create\na pipeline in which different computation steps can overlap if multiple jobs are given to\nthe pipeline. The following shows an illustration of pipeli ne parallelism for processing 3\nmicro-batches.\nWorkerL BL,1BL,2BL,3BL,1BL,2BL,3\n... ... ...\nWorker 2 B2,1B2,2B2,3 B2,1B2,2B2,3\nWorker 1B1,1B1,2B1,3 B1,1B1,2B1,3\nHere Bl,krepresents the processing of the k-th micro-batch by the l-th worker. Ideally we\nwould like to maximize the number of micro-batches, and thus minimize the idle time of the\n\n--- Page 70 ---\n\n2.2 Training at Scale 63\nworkers.

One problem, which is of ten associated with distributed\nsystems, is the cost of communication. We can think of a distr ibuted system as a group of net-\nworked nodes. Each of these nodes can perform local computat ion or pass data to other nodes. If\nthere are a large number of such nodes, it will be expensive to distribute and collect data across\nthem. Sometimes, the time savings brought about by parallel ism are offset by the communica-\ntion overhead of a large network. Another problem with large -scale distributed systems is that\nthe synchronization of nodes introduces additional costs. As is often the case, some nodes may\ntake longer to work, causing others to wait for the slowest on es. While we can use asynchronous\ntraining to handle heterogeneity in computational resourc es, this may lead to stale gradients and\nnon-guaranteed convergence. Moreover, as more nodes are ad ded to the network, there is more\nchance to have crashed nodes during training. In this case, w e need to ensure that the whole\nsystem is fault tolerant. In many practical settings, to inc rease scalability, one needs to take into\naccount additional issues, including architecture design , data transfer and computation overlap,\nload balancing, memory bandwidth and so on.\nTraining LLMs is so computationally expensive that, even th ough distributed training is al-\nready in use, researchers and engineers often still employ v arious model compression and speed-\nup methods to improve training efﬁciency [ Weng ,2021 ]. One example is mixed precision training,\nin which low precision data (such as FP16 and FP8 data) is used for gradient computation on each\nindividual node, and single or double precision data (such a s FP32/FP64 data) is used for updating\nthe model [ Micikevicius et al. ,2018 ]. A key operation in this approach is gradient accumulation\nwhere gradients need to be accumulated and synchronized acr oss nodes. However, due to the\nnon-associativity of ﬂoating-point addition, this can lea d to slight numerical differences in accu-\nmulated gradients on different nodes, which may affect mode l convergence and ﬁnal performance.\nThis problem is more obvious if there are a large number of nod es involved in distributed training,\nespecially given that low-precision numerical computatio ns may encounter overﬂow and under-\nﬂow issues, as well as inconsistencies across different har dware devices. Therefore, the design of\ndistributed systems needs to consider these numerical comp utation issues to ensure satisfactory\nresults and convergence.\n2.2.4 Scaling Laws\nThe success of LLMs reveals that training larger language mo dels using more resources can lead\nto improved model performance. Researchers have explained this as scaling laws of LLMs. More\nspeciﬁcally, scaling laws describe the relationships betw een the performance of LLMs and the\nattributes of LLM training, such as the model size, the amoun t of computation used for training,\nand the amount of training data. For example, Hestness et al. [2017 ] show that the performance of\ndeep neural networks is a power-law-like function of the tra ining data size.

The\ncurve of the scaling law can be divided into three phases. At t he beginning, the number of test errors decreases slowly\nwhen more training data is used, but this only lasts for a shor t period. In the second phase, the number of test errors\ndecreases drastically, and the curve becomes a power law cur ve. After that, the error reduction slows down again in the\nthird phase. Note that there are irreducible errors that can not be eliminated, regardless of the amount of training data .\nbecomes slow again, and more data does not lead to signiﬁcant gains. Figure 2.3shows an example\nof such curves.\nIn NLP, a traditional view holds that the performance gains w ill disappear at a certain point\nas the training is scaled up. However, recent results show th at, if we consider the problem on\na larger scale, scaling up training is still a very effective method for obtaining stronger LLMs.\nFor example, both closed-source and open-source LLMs can be neﬁt from more data, even though\ntrillions of tokens have already been used for training.\nWith the increase in the scale of model training, LLMs exhibi t new capabilities, known as the\nemergent abilities of LLMs. For example, Wei et al. [2022b ] studied the scaling properties of\nLLMs across different model sizes and amounts of computatio nal resources. Their work shows\nthat some abilities emerge when we scale the model size to cer tain level. The appearance of\nemergent abilities has demonstrated the role of scaled trai ning in enhancing the performance of\nLLMs, and it has also, to some extent, motivated researchers to continuously attempt to train larger\nmodels. As larger and stronger LMs continue to appear, our un derstanding of the scaling laws\ncontinues to mature. This helps researchers predict the per formance of LLMs during training and\nestimate the minimal computational resources required to a chieve a given level of performance.\nTo understand how model performance scales with various fac tors considered during training,\nit is common to express the model performance as a function of these factors. For example, in\nthe simplest case, we can express the loss or error of an LLM as a function of a single variable of\ninterest. However, there are no universal scaling laws that can describe this relationship. Instead,\ndifferent functions are proposed to ﬁt the learning curves o f LLMs.\nLetxbe the variable of interest (such as the number of model param eters) and L(x)be the\nloss of the model given x(such as the cross-entropy loss on test data).

The\nform of L(x)is then given by\nL(x) =axb+ǫ∞ (2.37)\nwhereǫ∞is the irreducible error that accounts for the error due to un known variables, which is\npresent even as x→ ∞ . Eq. ( 2.37) is one of the most widely used forms for designing scaling\nlaws of LLMs. For example, Rosenfeld et al. [2020 ] developed a scaling law that involves both\nmodel scaling and dataset scaling, like this\nL(N,D ) =aNb+cDd+ǫ∞ (2.38)\nAn example of such formulation is the Chinchilla scaling law . It states that the test loss per\ntoken is the sum of the inverse proportion functions of NandD, with an additional irreducible\nerror term. Hoffmann et al.

However, scalin g up can also occur in other directions.\nFor instance, in many applications, LLMs are adapted to proc ess signiﬁcantly long sequences. An\ninteresting example is that we pre-train an LLM on extensive texts of normal length and then ap-\nply it to deal with very long token sequences, far beyond the l ength encountered in pre-training.\nHere we use Pr(y|x)to denote the text generation probability where xis the context and yis the\ngenerated text. There are broadly three types of long sequen ce modeling problems.\n•Text generation based on long context (i.e., xis a long sequence). For example, we\ngenerate a short summary for a very long text.\n•Long text generation (i.e., yis a long sequence). For example, we generate a long story\nbased on a few keywords.\n•Long text generation based on long context (i.e., both xandyare long sequences). For\nexample, we translate a long document from Chinese to Englis h.\nRecently, NLP researchers have been more interested in appl ying and evaluating LLMs on\ntasks where extremely long input texts are involved. Imagin e an LLM, which reads a C++ source\nﬁle containing tens of thousands of lines, and outlines the f unctionality of the program correspond-\ning to the source ﬁle. Such models, capable of handling exten sive textual contexts, are sometimes\ncalled long-context LLMs . In this section we will restrict ourselves to long-context LLMs, but\nthe methods discussed here can be applicable to other proble ms.\nFor Transformers, dealing with long sequences is computati onally expensive, as the computa-\ntional cost of self-attention grows quadratically with the sequence length. This makes it infeasible\nto train and deploy such models for very long inputs. Two stra nds of research have tried to adapt\nTransformers to long-context language modeling.\n• The ﬁrst explores efﬁcient training methods and model arch itectures to learn self-attention\nmodels from long-sequence data.\n\n--- Page 74 ---\n\n2.3 Long Sequence Modeling 67\n• The other adapts pre-trained LLMs to handle long sequences with modest or no ﬁne-tuning\nefforts.\nHere, we will discuss the former brieﬂy since it can be found i n general discussions of efﬁcient\nTransformer architectures [ Tay et al. ,2020 ;Xiao and Zhu ,2023 ]. We will focus on the latter,\nhighlighting popular methods in recent LLMs. We will also di scuss the strengths and limitations\nof these long-sequence models.\n2.3.1 Optimization from HPC Perspectives\nWe begin our discussion by considering improvements to stan dard Transformer models from the\nperspectives of high-performance computing. Most of these improvements, though not speciﬁ-\ncally designed for LLMs, have been widely applied across var ious deep learning models [ Kim et al. ,\n2023 ]. A commonly used approach is to adopt a low-precision imple mentation of Transformers.\nFor example, we can use 8-bit or 16-bit ﬁxed-point data types for arithmetic operations, instead\nof 32-bit or 64-bit ﬂoating-point data types. Using these lo w-precision data types can increase\nthe efﬁciency and memory throughput, so that longer sequenc es can be processed more easily.\nAn alternative approach is to improve Transformers by using hardware-aware techniques. For\nexample, on modern GPUs, the efﬁciency of Transformers can b e improved by using IO-aware\nimplementations of the self-attention function [ Dao et al. ,2022 ;Kwon et al. ,2023 ].\nAnother way to handle long sequences is through sequence par allelism [ Li et al. ,2023b ;\nKorth",

As a result, the implementation of these methods can be base d on\nthe same parallel processing library.\n2.3.2 Efﬁcient Architectures\nOne difﬁculty of applying Transformers to long sequences is that self-attention has a quadratic\ntime complexity with respect to the sequence length. Moreov er, a key-value cache (orKV cache\nfor short) is maintained during inference, and its size incr eases as more tokens are processed. Al-\nthough the KV cache grows linearly with the sequence length, for extremely long input sequences,\nthe memory footprint becomes signiﬁcant and it is even infea sible to deploy LLMs for such tasks.\nAs a result, the model architecture of long-context LLMs gen erally moves away from the standard\n\n--- Page 76 ---\n\n2.3 Long Sequence Modeling 69\nTransformer, turning instead to the development of more efﬁ cient variants and alternatives.\nOne approach is to use sparse attention instead of standard s elf-attention. This family of\nmodels is based on the idea that only a small number of tokens a re considered important when\nattending to a given token, and so most of the attention weigh ts between tokens are close to zero.\nAs a consequence, we can prune most of the attention weights a nd represent the attention model\nin a compressed form. To illustrate, consider the self-atte ntion model\nAttqkv(Q,K,V) =α(Q,K)V (2.45)\nwhere the attention weight matrix α(Q,K)∈Rm×mis obtained by\nα(Q,K) = Softmax(QKT\n√\nd+Mask )\n=\nα0,0 0 0 ... 0\nα1,0α1,1 0... 0\nα2,0α2,1α2,2... 0\n...............\nαm−1,0αm−1,1αm−1,2... α m−1,m−1\n(2.46)\nEach row vector[\nαi,0... α i,i0...0]\ncorresponds to a distribution of attending the i-th\ntoken to every token of the sequence.

The memory footprint is determined by the r ecurrent state which has a ﬁxed size.\nRecurrent models can be used in real-time learning scenario s where data arrives in a stream and\npredictions can be made at any time step. In NLP, applying rec urrent models to language mod-\neling is one of the earliest successful attempts to learn rep resentations of sequences. Although\nTransformer has been used as the foundational architecture in LLMs, recurrent models are still\npowerful models, especially for developing efﬁcient LLMs. More recently, recurrent models have\nstarted their resurgence in language modeling and have been reconsidered as a promising alterna-\ntive to Transformers [ Gu and Dao ,2023 ].

We can write the\nattention operation at position iin a general form\nAtt(qi,Mem) = Att qkv(qi,K≤i,V≤i) (2.52)\nIn this model, Mem is simply the KV cache, i.e., Mem = ( K≤i,V≤i). Thus the size of\nMem is determined by i. If we deﬁne Mem as a ﬁxed-size variable, then the cost of performing\nAtt(qi,Mem) will be ﬁxed. There are several alternative ways to design Mem .\n• One of the simplest methods is to consider a ﬁxed-size windo w of previous keys and values.\nMem is therefore given by\nMem = ( K[i−nc+1,i],V[i−nc+1,i]) (2.53)\nwherencdenotes the size of the window. The notation K[i−nc+1,i]andV[i−nc+1,i]denote\nthe keys and values over positions from i−nc+ 1toi.11This model can be seen as a type\nof local attention model.\n• It is also possible to deﬁne Mem as a pair of summary vectors, which leads to a more\ncompressed representation of the history. A simple way to su mmarize the previous keys\nand values is to use the moving average of them. For example, Mem can be deﬁned as the\nunweighted moving average of the previous nckeys and values\nMem =(∑i\nj=i−nc+1kj\nnc,∑i\nj=i−nc+1vj\nnc)\n(2.54)\nAlternatively, we can use a weighted version of moving avera ge\nMem =(∑i\nj=i−nc+1βj−i+nckj∑nc\nj=1βj,∑i\nj=i−nc+1βj−i+ncvj∑nc\nj=1βj)\n(2.55)\nHere {β1,...,β nc}are the coefﬁcients, which can be either learned as model par ameters\nor determined via heuristics. For example, they can be set to increasing coefﬁcients (i.e.,\nβ1<β 2<...<β nc−1<β nc) in order to give larger weight to positions that are closer t o\n11More formally, we write K[i−nc+1,i]=\nki−nc+1\n...\nki\nandV[i−nc+1,i]=\nvi−nc+1\n...\nvi\n.

At each step, it takes both the pr evious\noutput of the memory and the current states of the model as inp ut, and produces the new\noutput of the memory. This neural network can be formulated a s the function\nMem = Update( Skv,Mem pre) (2.58)\nHere Mem andMem prerepresent the outputs of the memory at the current step and th e\nprevious step, respectively. Skvis a set of key-value pairs, representing the recent states o f\nthe model. This formulation is general and allows us to devel op various memory models by\nselecting different Update( ·)andSkvconﬁgurations. For example, if Skvonly contains the\nlatest key-value pair (ki,vi)andUpdate( ·)is deﬁned as a recurrent cell, then Eq. ( 2.58)\ncan be expressed as an RNN-like model\nMem =f((ki,vi),Mem pre) (2.59)\nwheref(·)is a recurrent cell. Recurrence can also be applied to segmen t-level modeling\nfor efﬁciency consideration. A simple approach is that we ca n divide the sequence into\nsegments, and treat Skvas a segment. Applying recurrent models to Update( ·)will result in\nmemory models that operate on segments. A special example is that we deﬁne Update( ·)as\nan FIFO function that adds Skvinto the memory and removes the oldest key-value segment\nfrom the memory, given by\nMem = FIFO( Skv,Mem pre) (2.60)\nConsider a memory which includes two segments, one for curre nt segment, and one for the\nprevious segment. In the attention operation, each positio n can access the history key-value\npairs in two closest consecutive segments. This essentiall y deﬁnes a local memory, but it\nand its variants have been widely used segment-level recurr ent models [ Dai et al. ,2019 ;\nHutchins et al. ,2022 ;Bulatov et al. ,2022 ].\n• The above memory models can be extended to involve multiple memories. An example\n\n--- Page 81 ---\n\n74 Generative Models\nof this approach is compressive Transformer [ Rae et al. ,2019 ]. It employs two distinct\nﬁxed-size memories: one for modeling local context (denote d by Mem ), and the other for\nmodeling and compressing long-term history (denoted by CMem ). The KV cache in this\nmodel is the combination of Mem andCMem . The attention function can be written as\nAttcom(qi,Mem,CMem) = Att qkv(qi,[Mem,CMem]) (2.61)\nwhere [Mem,CMem] is a combined memory of Mem andCMem . As with other segment-\nlevel models, the compressive Transformer model operates o n segments of the sequence.\nEach segment is a sequence of nsconsecutive tokens, and we denote Sk\nkvas the key-value\npairs corresponding to the tokens of the k-th segment. When a new segment arrives, Mem\nis updated in an FIFO fashion: we append the nckey-value pairs in Sk\nkvtoMem , and then\npop thensoldest key-value pairs from Mem , which is given by\nMem = FIFO( Sk\nkv,Mem pre) (2.62)\nThe popped key-value pairs are then used to update the compre ssive memory CMem .

Implicit in the compressive\nTransformer model is that local context should be represent ed explicitly with minimal in-\nformation loss, while long-range context can be more compre ssed.\n• We have already seen that both global and local contexts are useful and can be mod-\neled using attention models. This view motivates the extens ion to attention models for\ncombining both local and long-term memories [ Ainslie et al. ,2020 ;Zaheer et al. ,2020 ;\nGupta and Berant ,2020 ]. A simple but widely-used approach is to involve the ﬁrst fe w to-\nkens of the sequence in attention, serving as global tokens. This approach is usually applied\nalong with other sparse attention models. An advantage of in corporating global tokens of\nthe sequence is that it helps smooth the output distribution of the Softmax function used in\nattention weight computation, and thus stabilizes model pe rformance when the context size\nis very large [ Xiao et al. ,2024 ]. One drawback, however, is that using a ﬁxed-size global\nmemory may result in information loss. When dealing with lon g sequences, we need to\nenlarge the KV cache for sufﬁcient representations of the co ntext, but this in turn increases\nthe computational cost.\nFigure 2.6shows illustrations of the above approaches.

We now consider another family\nof models, called external memories , which operate as independent models to access large-scale\ncontexts for LLMs. Many such models are based on memory-based methods which have been\nextensively discussed in machine learning [ Bishop ,2006 ]. A common example is nearest neigh-\nbor algorithms: we store context representations in a datas tore, and try to ﬁnd the most similar\nstored representations to match a given query. The retrieve d context representations are then used\nto improve attention for this query.\nHere, we consider the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) method which is one of the most popular\nmemory-based methods. Since our focus is language modeling in this section, we deﬁne a sample\nin the datastore as a key-value pair corresponding to some co ntext state. Note that “context” is a\nbroad concept here, not just a sequence preﬁx in text generat ion. One might, for example, view\nthe entire dataset as the context for predicting tokens. Thi s allows us to retrieve the closest context\nsituation in a set of sequences, rather than a given sequence preﬁx. Although we will restrict\nourselves to context modeling for a single sequence, in this subsection, we discuss a relatively\nmore general case.\nSuppose we have a set of keys {kj}with corresponding values {vj}, and suppose we store\nthese key-value pairs in a vector database12. For each query qi, we ﬁnd itsknearest neighbours by\ngrowing the radius of the sphere centered as qiuntil it contains kdata points in {kj}. This results\nin a set ofkkeys along with their corresponding values, denoted by Mem knn. As before, we\ndenote Mem as the local memory for the query, such as the KV cache of neigh boring tokens. Our\ngoal is to attend query qito both the local memory Mem and the long-term memory Mem knn.\nThere are, of course, several ways to incorporate Mem andMem knninto the attention model.\nFor example, we might simply combine them to form a single KV c ache [Mem,Mem knn], and\nattend qito[Mem,Mem knn]via standard QKV attention. Or we might use Mem andMem knn\nin separate attention steps. An example of such approaches i s the model developed by Wu et al.\n[2021 ]. It linearly combines the two types of attention, given by\nAtt(qi,Mem,Mem knn) = g⊙Attlocal+ (1 −g)⊙Attknn (2.64)\nAttlocal = Att( qi,Mem) (2.65)\nAttknn= Att( qi,Mem knn) (2.66)\nHere g∈Rdis the coefﬁcient vector, which can be the output of a learned gate.\nGiven thek-NN-based memory model described above, the remaining task is to determine\nwhich key-value pairs are retained in the datastore. For sta ndard language modeling tasks, we\nconsider the previously seen tokens in a sequence as the cont ext, so we can add the keys and\nvalues of all these tokens into the datastore. In this case, t he resulting k-NN-based attention\nmodel is essentially equivalent to a sparse attention model [Gupta et al. ,2021 ].\nAlternatively, we can extend the context from one sequence t o a collection of sequences.\nFor example, we might collect all key-value pairs across the sequences in a training dataset and\nadd them to the datastore to model a larger context. Thus, LLM s can predict tokens based on a\n12A vector database, or vector store, is a database that provid es highly optimized retrieval interfaces",

A problem with this approach is that th e computational cost would be large\nif many sequences are involved. Since these sequences are pa rt of our training data, we can build\nand optimize an index for the vectors in the datastore before running the LLMs. As a result, the\nretrieval of similar vectors can be very efﬁcient, as in most vector databases.\nIn fact, all the above-mentioned methods can be viewed as ins tances of a retrieval-based ap-\nproach. Instead of using retrieval results to improve atten tion, we can apply this approach in other\nways as well. One application of k-NN-based search is k-NN language modeling (ork-NN LM )\n[Khandelwal et al. ,2020 ]. The idea is that, although it is attempting to extend the co ntext used\nin self-attention by incorporating nearest neighbors in re presentation learning, in practice, similar\nhidden states in Transformers are often highly predictive o f similar tokens in subsequent positions.\nInk-NN LM, each item in the datastore is a key-value tuple (z,w), where zrepresents a hidden\nstate of the LLM at a position, and wrepresents the corresponding prediction. A typical way to\ncreate the datastore is to collect the output vector of the Tr ansformer layer stack and the corre-\nsponding next token for each position of each sequence in a tr aining dataset. During inference,\nwe have a representation higiven a preﬁx. Given this representation, we ﬁrst search the datastore\nforkclosest matching data items {(z1,w1),...,(zk,wk)}. Here {w1,...,w k}are thought of as\nreference tokens for prediction, and thus can be used to guid e the token prediction based on hi.\nOne common way to make use of reference tokens is to deﬁne a dis tribution over the vocabulary\nV,\nPrknn(·|hi) = Softmax([\n−d0· · · −d|V|]\n) (2.67)\nwheredvequals the distance between hiandzjifwjequals thev-th entry of V, and equals 0\notherwise. We use a linear function with a coefﬁcient λthat interpolates between the retrieval-\nbased distribution Prknn(·|hi)and the LLM output distribution Prlm(·|hi)\nPr(·|hi) =λ·Prknn(·|hi) + (1 −λ)·Prlm(·|hi) (2.68)\nThen, as usual, we can choose the next token yby maximizing the probability Pr(y|hi).\nAs with information retrieval (IR) systems, the datastore c an also manage texts and provide\naccess to relevant texts for a query. For example, we can stor e a collection of text documents\nin a search engine with full-text indexing, and then search i t for documents that match a given\ntext-based query.

One\nadvantage of RAG is that we need not modify the architecture o f LLMs, but instead augment the\ninput to LLMs via an additional IR system. Figure 2.7shows a comparison of the use of different\nexternal memories in LLMs.\n2.3.3.3 Memory Capacity\nA memory model in LLMs, in the form of a simple key-value cache or a datastore, can broadly\nbe seen as an encoder of contextual information. Ideally, be fore we say that a memory model\nis representative of the entire context in token prediction , we need to make sure that the model\ncan accurately represent any part of the context. The standa rd KV cache is one such model that\ncompletely stores all past history. In this case, the model i s said to have adequate capacity for\nmemorizing the context. In many practical applications, ho wever, complete memorization is not\nrequired. Instead, the goal is to enable LLMs to access impor tant contextual information. As a\nresult, efﬁcient and compressed memory models are develope d, as described in this section. Note\nthat, the longer the sequence, the more difﬁcult it becomes f or a low-capacity memory model to\ncapture important contextual information. It is therefore common practice to simply increase the\nmodel capacity when processing long contexts.\nWhile high-capacity models are generally favorable, they a re difﬁcult to train and deploy. A\nchallenging scenario is that the tokens arrive in a stream an d the context continuously grows.\nDeveloping LLMs for such tasks is difﬁcult as we need to train Transformers on extremely long\nsequences. A possible way to address this difﬁculty is to use non-parametric methods, such as\nretrieval-based methods. For example, as discussed above, we can use a vector database to store\npreviously generated key-value pairs, and thus represent t he context by this external memory\nmodel. Although this approach side-steps the challenge of r epresenting long context in Trans-\nformers, building and updating external memory models are c omputationally expensive. These\nmodels are more often used in problems where the context is gi ven in advance and ﬁxed during\ninference, and hence unsuitable for streaming context mode ling.\nIn cases where the size of the context continuously grows, ap plying ﬁxed-size memory models\nis a commonly used approach. For example, in recurrent model s, a sequence of arbitrary length\ncan be summarized into a set of hidden states by which we have a ﬁxed computational cost per\nstep. While recurrent models were initially found to be not v ery good at handling long-distance\ndependencies in sequence modeling in early applications of deep learning to NLP, recent advance-\nments have shown that their variants are now effective in mod eling extremely long sequences.\n[Bulatov et al. ,2022 ;Hutchins et al. ,2022 ;Munkhdalai et al. ,2024 ;Ma et al. ,2024 ].\n14For example, the template could be:\nmessage = {* c1*} ... {* ck*}\ninput: {* x*}\noutput:\n\n--- Page 86 ---\n\n2.3 Long Sequence Modeling 79\n· · ·\n· · ·\nDatastoreqi\nSearchKV Cache kNearest\nNeighborsAtt(qi,Mem) Att(qi,Mem knn)g⊙Att(qi,Mem) + (1 −g)⊙Att(qi,Mem knn)\nKeys/values in LLM\nKeys/values",

F or example, memory capacity could\nbe deﬁned by the size of the KV cache in Transformers or the vec tor database used in retrieval-\nbased methods. A related concept is model complexity. In mac hine learning, there are several\nways to deﬁne the model complexity of a model. One of the simpl est methods is by counting the\nnumber of parameters. However, it should be emphasized that the memory models discussed here\nprimarily serve to store information, rather than add train able parameters. Therefore, a model with\na large memory capacity is not necessarily more complex. Nev ertheless, in practice determining\nthe capacity of a memory model is not straightforward. In gen eral, we need to control the trade-off\nbetween maximizing the performance and controlling the mem ory footprint.\n2.3.4 Sharing across Heads and Layers\nIn Transformers, the KV cache is a data structure that can be d ynamically adjusted along multiple\ndimensions, such as heads, layers, and sequence length. For example, consider an LLM with L\nlayers. Each layer has τattention heads, and each head produces a dh-dimensional output. During\ninference, we store the keys and values for up to mtokens. The space complexity of this caching\nmechanism is O(L·τ·dh·m). As we have seen previously, this complexity can be reduced b y\ncaching the keys and values for fewer tokens. For example, in sliding window attention, a ﬁxed-\nsize window is used to cache the keys and values in local conte xt. And this model has a space\ncomplexity of O(L·τ·dh·mw), withmwbeing the size of the window.\nIn addition to reducing m, we can also decrease the size of the KV cache along other di-\nmensions. A widely-used approach is to enable sharing acros s heads in multi-head self-attention.\nRecall from Section 2.1.1 that multi-head self-attention uses multiple sets of queri es, keys, and\nvalues (each set is called a head), each performing the QKV at tention mechanism as usual. This\ncan be expressed as\nOutput = Merge(head 1,...,head τ)Whead(2.70)\nwhere head j∈Rdhis computed using the standard QKV attention function\nhead j= Att qkv(q[j]\ni,K[j]\n≤i,V[j]\n≤i) (2.71)\nHere, q[j]\ni,K[j]\n≤i, and V[j]\n≤iare the query, keys, and values that are projected onto the j-th feature\nsub-space. So this model can be interpreted as performing at tention on a group of feature sub-\nspaces in parallel (see Figure 2.8(b)).",

A straightforward approach is to treat PE(i)\nas a learnable variable and train it alongside other model pa rameters. In this way, we can learn\na unique representation for each position, and thus disting uish the tokens appearing at different\npositions of a sequence.\nRepresentations of positions using learned vectors can wor k well in tasks where the sequences\nat training and test times are of similar lengths. In practic e, however, we often impose length\nrestrictions on sequences during training to prevent exces sive computational costs, but wish to\napply the trained models to much longer sequences during inf erence. In this case, using learned\npositional embeddings has obvious drawbacks, as there are n o trained embeddings for positions\nthat are not observed in the training phase.\nAn alternative approach to modeling positional informatio n is to develop positional embed-\ndings that can generalize: once trained, the embedding mode l can be used to handle longer se-\nquences. Suppose that we train a positional embedding model on sequences with a maximum\nlength ofml, and we wish to apply the trained model to a sequence of length m(m >> m l). If\nthe embedding model is limited in the range of positions that we can observe from training data,\nthen this model will simply fail to deal with new data outside that range. See Figure 2.9(a) for\nan illustration where the learned embedding model cannot mo del data points outside the training\ndomain if it lacks the ability to extrapolate.\nThere are several approaches to making positional embeddin g models generalize. They can\nbe grouped into two classes.\n•Extrapolation . The model learned on observed data points (i.e., positions ) can be directly\nemployed to assign meaningful values to data points beyond t he original range. For ex-\nample, suppose we have a series of numbers 1,2,...,10, and we want to understand the\nmeaning of a new number, 15. Knowing that these numbers are na tural numbers used for\nordering, we can easily infer that 15 is a number that follows 10, even though 15 has not\n\n--- Page 90 ---\n\n2.3 Long Sequence Modeling 83\n0 1 ,024 2 ,048−101\nSequence Length\n(a) Encoding with No GeneralizationValue\n0 1 ,024 2 ,048−101\nSequence Length\n(b) ExtrapolationValue\n0 1 ,024 2 ,048−101\nSequence Length\n(c) InterpolationValue\nFig. 2.9: Illustrations of different positional embedding methods f or a range of positions.

This approach maps a larger range of data points into the ori ginal obser-\nvation range. For example, suppose we have a model designed f or numbers in the range\n[1,10]. When given a new range of [1,20], we can scale this down by dividing every num-\nber by 2, thereby ﬁtting all numbers into [1,10]. This scaling allows us to use the model\ntrained on the range [1,10]to describe data points in the expanded range of [1,20]. See\nFigure 2.9(c) for an illustration of this approach.\nIn fact, positional embeddings in many systems have achieve d some level of generalization.\nFor example, sinusoidal encoding, the most common position al embedding method, employs sine\nand cosine functions that can naturally extend to sequences of any length. Although this approach\nmight seem direct and simple, it does not perform well when we signiﬁcantly extend the sequences\nfor processing. In this subsection, we will discuss several alternative methods based on either\nextrapolation or interpolation.\n\n--- Page 91 ---\n\n84 Generative Models\n2.3.5.1 Attention with Learnable Biases\nOne problem with Eq. ( 2.74) is that the embedding model treats each token independentl y and\ntherefore ignores the distance between different tokens. A common improvement to this model,\ncalled relative positional embedding, is to consider the pa irwise relationship between tokens\n[Shaw et al. ,2018 ]. The general idea behind this is to obtain the offset betwee n any pair of posi-\ntions and incorporate it into the self-attention model. One of the simplest forms of self-attention\nwith relative positional embedding is given by\nAttqkv(qi,K≤i,V≤i) =i∑\nj=0α(i,j)vj (2.75)\nα(i,j) = Softmax(qikT\nj+PE(i,j)√\nd+ Mask(i,j)) (2.76)\nThe only difference between this model and the original self -attention model is that a bias term\nPE(i,j)is added to the query-key product in this new model. Intuitiv ely,PE(i,j)can be inter-\npreted as a distance penalty for the pair of positions iandj. Asimoves away from j, the value of\nPE(i,j)decreases.\nPE(i,j)can be deﬁned in several different ways. Here, we consider th e T5 version of relative\npositional embedding, called the T5 bias [ Raffel et al. ,2020 ]. For each pair of query qiand key\nkj, the offset between them is deﬁned to be15\nd(i,j) =i−j (2.77)\nA simple design for the bias PE(i,j)is to share the same learnable variable for all query-key\npairs with the same offset, i.e., PE(i,j) =ui−j, whereui−jis the variable corresponding to\nthe offseti−j. However, simply assigning a unique value to each offset wil l restrict this model\nto observed offsets. When i−jis larger than the maximum trained offset, the model cannot\ngeneralize.\nThe T5 bias instead adopts a generalization of this model. Ra ther than assigning each query-\nkey offset a unique bias term, it groups difference offsets i nto “buckets”, each corresponding to\none learnable parameter. More speciﬁcally, the bias terms f ornb+ 1buckets are given as follows.\n• For buckets 0 tonb+1\n2−1, each bucket corresponds to one offset, that is, bucket 0 ↔offset\n0, bucket 1 ↔offset 1, bucket 2 ↔offset 2, and so on. We express this as b(i−j) =i−j.\n• For bucketsnb+1\n2tonb,",

An alternative approach is to give th ese biases ﬁxed values via heuristics,\nrather than training them on a particular dataset. One beneﬁ t of this heuristics-based approach is\nthat it does not rely on a training process and thus can be dire ctly applied to any sequences once\nthe biases are set.\nOne example of such an approach is Press et al. [2022 ]’s approach, called attention with\nlinear biases orALiBi for short. In the ALiBi approach, the bias term is deﬁned as th e negative\nscaled query-key offset\nPE(i,j) = −β·(i−j)\n=β·(j−i) (2.82)\nwhereβis the scaling factor. Adding this term to the query-key prod uct, we obtain a new form of\nattention weights\nα(i,j) = Softmax(qikT\nj+β·(j−i)√\nd+ Mask(i,j)) (2.83)\nThis model can be interpreted as adding a ﬁxed penalty to qikT\njwheneverjmoves one step\naway fromi. So we do not need to adapt it to a range of sequence lengths, an d can employ it to\nmodel arbitrarily long sequences. See Figure 2.11 for a comparison of the T5 bias and the ALiBi\nbias.\nIn general, the scalar βshould be tuned on a validation dataset. However, Press et al. [2022 ]\nfound that setting βto values decreasing geometrically by a factor of1\n2afor multi-head attention\nperforms well on a variety of tasks. Speciﬁcally, for a self- attention sub-layer involving nhead\nheads, the scalar for the k-th head is given by\nβk=1\n28\nk(2.84)\nThe ALiBi approach provides a simple form of relative positi onal embeddings. There are\nother similar methods for designing query-key biases using the offseti−j. Table 2.4shows a\ncomparison of such biases. As an aside it is worth noting that the form of the right-hand side\nof Eq. ( 2.82) is very similar to length features used in conventional fea ture-based systems.

If two or more rotations are performe d on the\nsame vector, we can rotate the vector further. This follows f rom the fact that the composition of\nsuccessive rotations is itself a rotation. More formally, r otating a vector by an angle θforttimes\ncan be expressed as\nRo(x,tθ) = xRtθ\n=[\ncostθ·x1−sintθ·x2sintθ·x1+ costθ·x2]\n(2.87)\nIf we interpret tas the position of a token represented by xin a sequence, then we will ﬁnd\nthat the above equation deﬁnes a simple positional embeddin g model. As shown in Figure 2.12\n(b), we start moving the token from position 0. Each time we mo ve one step forward, the vector\nis rotated by the angle θ. Upon arriving at the position t, the representation of the token with\npositional context is given by Ro(x,iθ). As the rotations do not change the magnitude of the\nembedding, the original “meaning” of the token is retained. The positional information is injected\ninto the embedding, when it gets rotated.\nA popular way to understand vector rotation is to deﬁne it in c omplex spaces.

We\nclose this section by discussing some interesting issues re lated to these methods.\n2.3.6.1 Need for Long Context\nOne of the ultimate goals of long-context LLMs is that these m odels can precisely encode inﬁnite\ncontext. The so-called inﬁnite context refers more to the fa ct that an LLM can continuously read\nwords. This motivates LLMs that can handle extremely long co ntext or stream data. As discussed\nin Section 2.3.3 , it is common to use ﬁxed-size memory models to process conti nuously expanding\ncontext. Many such systems are based on recurrent architect ures or their variants, because they\nare inherently suited to model time series problems where th e effects of past inputs continue\nindeﬁnitely. Another way to achieve inﬁnite memory is to dev elop alternatives to self-attention\nmodels, for example, one can use continuous-space attentio n models to encode context, which\nremoves the dependency on context length [ Martins et al. ,2022 ].\nWhen studying long-context LLMs, it is natural to wonder wha t mechanisms may explain the\nuse of long context in language modeling. Can we compress the representation of inﬁnite context\ninto a relatively small-sized model? Are all context tokens useful for predicting next tokens? How\ndo LLMs prepare for token prediction when they see the contex t? Can we know in advance which\ncontextual information will be critical for prediction? Ge neral answers to all these questions\nare not obvious, but they inspire follow-on research of expl ainable models, and some interesting\nresults have been found.",

[2024 ] conducted extensive experiments\nto show that LLMs are powerful in-context compressors. Alth ough viewing predictive models\nas compression models has long been studied in machine learn ing, it also provides insights into\nour understanding of the LLM scaling laws. Pal et al. [2023 ] and Wu et al. [2024 ] investigated\nwhether the features learned up to the current step, though n ot intentionally, are already sufﬁcient\n\n--- Page 100 ---\n\n2.3 Long Sequence Modeling 93\nfor predicting tokens at the following steps. Note that the n eed for long-context in language\nmodeling is highly dependent on the problem that we address. A related issue is where to apply\nLLMs and how to evaluate them. For example, in summarization tasks we may only need to distill\nand focus on a few key aspects of the text, while in retrieval- like tasks we need to “memorize”\nthe entire context so that the relevant information can be ac cessed. We will discuss the evaluation\nissue later in this subsection.\n2.3.6.2 Pre-training or Adapting LLMs?\nTraining LLMs requires signiﬁcant computational costs. Al though it is straightforward to train\nLLMs on long sequence data, the training becomes computatio nally unwieldy for large data sets. It\nis common practice to pre-train LLMs on general datasets, an d then adapt them with modest ﬁne-\ntuning effort. For example, LLMs with relative or rotary pos itional embeddings can be directly\ntrained on large-scale data in the pre-training phase. Whil e the resulting models may exhibit some\nabilities to extrapolate lengths in the inference phase, it may be more effective to ﬁne-tune them\non longer sequences.\nIdeally, we would like to pre-train LLMs with standard Trans former architectures and adapt\nthem to new tasks. This allows us to use many off-the-shelf LL Ms and efﬁciently adapt them to\nhandle long sequences. However, when new architectures are adopted, it seems inevitable that\nwe need to train these models from scratch. This poses practi cal difﬁculties for developing long-\ncontext LLMs, as we cannot leverage well-developed, pre-tr ained models and must instead train\nthem ourselves. On the other hand, ﬁne-tuning is still an eff ective way to adapt LLMs with certain\narchitectures that are different from those in pre-trainin g. An example is models augmented with\nexternal memories. In these models, the pre-trained LLMs ar e ﬁxed, and the focus is on how\nto make these LLMs collaborate with the memory models. In RAG , for instance, it is common\nto ﬁne-tune LLMs to improve their use of retrieval-augmente d inputs. Another example of ﬁne-\ntuning LLMs for long-context modeling is that we train an LLM with full attention models, and\nthen replace them with sparse attention models in the ﬁne-tu ning phase. The pre-trained LLM\nprovides initial values of model parameters used in a differ ent model, and this model is then ﬁne-\ntuned as usual.\n2.3.6.3 Evaluating Long-context LLMs\nEvaluating long-context LLMs is important, but it is a new is sue in NLP. The general idea is that,\nif we input a long context to an LLM, then we can check from the o utput of the LLM whether it\nunderstands the entire context and makes use of it in predict ing following tokens.

In conventional\nresearch of NLP, such evaluations are often aimed at examini ng the ability of NLP models in\nhandling long-range dependencies. However, the size of con texts used in recent LLMs is much\nlarger than that used in NLP systems a few years ago. This moti vates researchers to develop new\nevaluation benchmarks and metrics for long-context LLMs.\nOne approach is to use the perplexity metric. However, in spi te of its apparent simplicity, this\nmethod tends to reﬂect more on the LLMs’ ability to make use of local context rather than global\ncontext. It is therefore tempting to develop evaluation met hods that are speciﬁc to long-context\nLLMs. Popular methods include various synthetic tasks wher e artiﬁcially generated or modiﬁed\n\n--- Page 101 ---\n\n94 Generative Models\ndata is used to evaluate speciﬁc capabilities of long-conte xt LLMs. In needle-in-a-haystack18and\npasskey retrieval tasks [ Mohtashami and Jaggi ,2024 ;Chen et al. ,2023c ], for instance, LLMs are\nrequired to identify and extract a small, relevant piece of i nformation from a large volume of given\ntext. The assumption here is that an LLM with sufﬁcient memor y should remember earlier parts\nof the text as it processes new information. This LLM can thus pick out the relevant details, which\nmight be sparse and hidden among much irrelevant informatio n, from the text. Alternatively,\nin copy memory tasks (or copy tasks for short), LLMs are used t o repeat the input text or a\nspeciﬁc segment multiple times. These tasks were initially proposed to test the extent to which\nrecurrent models can retain and recall previously seen toke ns [Hochreiter and Schmidhuber ,1997 ;\nArjovsky et al. ,2016 ], and have been adopted in evaluating recent LLMs [ Bulatov et al. ,2022 ;\nGu and Dao ,2023 ].\nAnother approach to evaluating long-context LLMs is to test them on NLP tasks that involve\nvery long input sequences. Examples include long-document or multi-document summarization,\nlong-document question answering, code completion, and so on. A beneﬁt of this approach is that\nit can align evaluations with user expectations.\nAlthough many methods have been developed, there is still no general way to evaluate long-\ncontext LLMs [ Liu et al. ,2024c ]. One problem is that most of these methods focus on speciﬁc\naspects of LLMs, rather than their fundamental ability to mo del very long contexts. Even though\nan LLM can pick out the appropriate piece of text from the inpu t, we cannot say that it truly un-\nderstands the entire context. Instead, it might just rememb er some important parts of the context,\nor even simply recall the answer via the model learned in pre- training. Moreover, the data used\nin many tasks is small-scale and relatively preliminary, le ading to discrepancies between evalu-\nation results and actual application performance. A more in teresting issue is that the results of\nLLMs are inﬂuenced by many other factors and experimental se tups, for example, using different\nprompts can lead to very different outcomes. This makes eval uation even more challenging be-\ncause improvements may not solely result from better modeli ng of long contexts, and there is a\nrisk of overclaiming our results. Nevertheless, many open q uestions remain in the development\nand evaluation of long-context LLMs. For example, these mod els still suffer from limitations\nsuch as restricted context length and high latency.

This can be consid-\nered a general, though not comprehensive, introduction to L LMs, laying the foundation for further\ndiscussions on more advanced topics in subsequent chapters . Furthermore, we have explored two\nways to scale up LLMs. The ﬁrst focuses on the large-scale pre -training of LLMs, which is cru-\ncial for developing state-of-the-art models. The second fo cuses on methods for adapting LLMs to\nlong inputs, including optimizing attention models, desig ning more efﬁcient and compressed KV\ncaches, incorporating memory models, and exploring better positional embeddings.\nThe strength of LLMs lies in their ability to break the constr aints of training NLP models for\na limited number of speciﬁc tasks. Instead, LLMs learn from l arge amounts of text through the\nsimple task of token prediction — we predict the next token in a sentence given its prior tokens.\n18https://github.com/gkamradt/LLMTest_NeedleInAHaysta ck\n\n--- Page 102 ---\n\n2.4 Summary 95\nA general view is that, by repeating this token prediction ta sk a large number of times, LLMs can\nacquire some knowledge of the world and language, which can t hen be applied to new tasks. As a\nresult, LLMs can be prompted to perform any task by framing it as a task of predicting subsequent\ntokens given prompts. This emergent ability in language mod els comes from several dimensions,\nsuch as scaling up training, model size, and context size. It is undeniable that scaling laws are\ncurrently the fundamental principle adopted in developing large language models, although sim-\nply increasing model size has yet to prove sufﬁcient for achi eving AGI. These continuously scaled\nLLMs have been found to show capabilities in general-purpos e language understanding, genera-\ntion, and reasoning. More recently, it has been found that sc aling up the compute at inference time\ncan also lead to signiﬁcant improvements in complex reasoni ng tasks [ OpenAI ,2024 ].\nGiven their amazing power, LLMs have attracted considerabl e interest, both in terms of tech-\nniques and applications. As a result, the explosion of resea rch interest in LLMs has also led to a\nvast number of new techniques and models. However, we do not a ttempt to provide a comprehen-\nsive literature review on all aspects of LLMs, given the rapi d evolution of the ﬁeld. Nevertheless,\none can still gain knowledge about LLMs from general reviews [Zhao et al. ,2023 ;Minaee et al. ,\n2024 ] or more focused discussions on speciﬁc topics [ Ruan et al. ,2024 ].\n\n--- Page 103 ---\n\nCHAPTER 3\nPrompting\nIn the context of LLMs, prompting refers to the method of providing an LLM with a speciﬁc input\nor cue to generate a desired output or perform a task.

For exam ple, if we want the LLM to translate\na sentence from English to Chinese, we can prompt it like this\nTranslate the text from English to Chinese.\nText: The early bird catches the worm.\nTranslation:\nPrompting is crucial for LLMs because it directly inﬂuences how effectively these models under-\nstand and respond to user queries. A well-crafted prompt can guide an LLM to generate more\naccurate, relevant, and contextually appropriate respons es. Furthermore, this process can be iter-\natively reﬁned. By analyzing the responses of the LLM, users can adjust their prompts to align\nmore closely with their speciﬁc needs. Given the importance of prompting in applying LLMs,\nprompt design has become an essential skill for users and dev elopers working with LLMs. This\nleads to an active research area, called prompt engineering , in which we design effective prompts\nto make better use of LLMs and enhance their practical utilit y in real-world applications.\nAn important concept related to prompting is in-context learning . When prompting an LLM,\nwe can add new information to the context, such as demonstrat ions of problem-solving. This\nallows the LLM to learn from this context how to solve the prob lem. Here is an example of\nprompting LLMs with a few demonstrations of how to classify t ext based on sentiment polarity.\nHere are some examples of text classiﬁcation.\nExample 1: We had a delightful dinner together. →Label: Positive\nExample 2: I’m frustrated with the delays. →Label: Negative\nWhat is the label for “That comment was quite hurtful.”?\nLabel:\nIn-context learning is often seen as an emergent ability of L LMs that arises after pre-training.\nThough LLMs can be trained or tuned to perform new tasks, in-c ontext learning provides a very\nefﬁcient way to adapt these models without any training or tu ning effort. Perhaps this is one of\nthe most notable features of LLMs: they indeed learn general knowledge about the world and\nlanguage during pre-training, which we can easily apply to n ew challenges. Moreover, in-context\nlearning reﬂects the broader trend of making AI systems more generalizable and user-friendly.\nInstead of requiring specialized engineers to ﬁne-tune mod els for every unique task, users can\ninteract with LLMs in a more intuitive way, simply providing examples or adjusting the context\nas needed.\nIn this chapter, we focus on prompting techniques in LLMs. We begin by considering several\ninteresting prompt designs commonly used in prompt enginee ring. Then, we discuss a series of\n96\n\n--- Page 104 ---\n\n3.1 General Prompt Design 97\nreﬁnements to these methods. Finally, we explore approache s for automating prompt design.\n3.1 General Prompt Design\nThis section presents basic concepts in prompt design, alon g with examples of how to prompt\nLLMs for various NLP tasks. Since the effectiveness of promp ting is highly dependent on the\nLLMs being used, prompts often vary across different LLMs, m aking it difﬁcult to provide a\ncomprehensive list of prompts for all LLMs and downstream ta sks. Therefore, this discussion is\nnot focused on any speciﬁc LLM. Instead, the goal is to provid e guiding principles for prompt\ndesign.\n3.1.1 Basics\nThe term prompt is used in many different ways. In this chapter we deﬁne a prom pt as the input\ntext to an LLM, denoted by x.

Zero-shot learning, a s its name implies, does not involve a\ntraditional “learning” process. It instead directly appli es LLMs to address new problems that were\nnot observed during training. In practice, we can repetitiv ely adjust prompts to guide the LLMs in\ngenerating better responses, without demonstrating probl em-solving steps or providing examples.\nConsider the following example. Suppose we want to use an LLM as an assistant that can help\ncorrect English sentences.

On the other hand, strong er LLMs can make better use of in-\ncontext learning for performing new tasks. For example, sup pose we wish to use an LLM to\ntranslate words from Inuktitut to English. If the LLM lacks p re-training on Inuktitut data, its\nunderstanding of Inuktitut will be weak, and it will be difﬁc ult for the model to perform well in\ntranslation regardless of how we prompt it. In this case, we n eed to continue training the LLM\nwith more Inuktitut data, rather than trying to ﬁnd better pr ompts.\nIt might be interesting to explore how in-context learning e merges during pre-training and\nwhy it works during inference. One simple understanding is t hat LLMs have gained some knowl-\nedge of problem-solving, but there are many possible predic tions, which are hard to distinguish\nwhen the models confront new problems. Providing demonstra tions can guide the LLMs to fol-\nlow the “correct” paths. Furthermore, some researchers hav e tried to interpret in-context learn-\ning from several different perspectives, including Bayesi an inference [ Xie et al. ,2022 ], gradient\ndecent [ Dai et al. ,2023 ;V on Oswald et al. ,2023 ], linear regression [ Akyürek et al. ,2023 ], meta\nlearning [ Garg et al. ,2022 ], and so on.\n3.1.3 Prompt Engineering Strategies\nDesigning prompts is highly empirical. In general, there ar e many ways to prompt an LLM for\nperforming the same task, and we need to perform a number of tr ial-and-error runs to ﬁnd a\nsatisfactory prompt. To write good prompts more efﬁciently , one can follow certain strategies.\nExamples of common prompting principles include\n\n--- Page 109 ---\n\n102 Prompting\n•Describing the task as clearly as possible . When we apply an LLM to solve a problem,\nwe need to provide a precise, speciﬁc, and clear description of the problem and instruct the\nLLM to perform as we expect. This is particularly important w hen we want the output of\nthe LLM to meet certain expectations. For example, suppose w e are curious about climate\nchange.

LLMs have exhibited surprisingly good capabilities to “th ink”.\nA common example is that well-developed LLMs have achieved i mpressive performance\nin mathematical reasoning tasks, which are considered chal lenging. In prompt engineering,\nthe “thinking” ability of LLMs needs to be activated through appropriate prompting, espe-\ncially for problems that require signiﬁcant reasoning effo rts. In many cases, an LLM that\nis instructed to “think” can produce completely different r esults compared with the same\nLLM that is instructed to perform the task straightforwardl y. For example, Kojima et al.\n[2022 ] found that simply appending “Let’s think step by step” to th e end of each prompt\ncan improve the performance of LLMs on several reasoning tas ks. LLMs can be prompted\nto “think” in a number of ways. One method is to instruct LLMs t o generate steps for rea-\nsoning about the problem before reaching the ﬁnal answer. Fo r example, consider a task of\nsolving mathematical problems. See below for a simple promp t for this task.\n\n--- Page 110 ---\n\n3.1 General Prompt Design 103\nYou are a mathematician. You will be provided with a math prob lem.\nPlease solve the problem.\nSince solving math problems requires a detailed reasoning p rocess, LLMs would probably\nmake mistakes if they attempted to work out the answer direct ly. So we can explicitly ask\nLLMs to follow a given reasoning process before coming to a co nclusion.\nYou are a mathematician. You will follow these detailed reas oning steps\nwhen solving math problems.\nStep 1: Problem Interpretation.\nThe mathematician carefully listens to your query and under stands the in-\ntricate details of the mathematical challenge you have pres ented.\nStep 2: Strategy Formulation.\nDrawing upon their extensive knowledge, the mathematician chooses the\nmost effective strategy tailored to the type of math problem , whether it is\nalgebra, calculus, or geometry.\nStep 3: Detailed Calculation.\nWith precision and expertise, the mathematician performs t he necessary\ncalculations step by step, adhering to all mathematical pri nciples.\nStep 4: Solution Review.\nBefore providing the ﬁnal answer, the mathematician meticu lously checks\nthe calculations for accuracy and offers a concise explanat ion or rationale\nfor the solution.\nYou will be provided with a math problem. Please solve the pro blem.\n{∗problem ∗}\nAnother method to guide LLMs to “think” is through multiple r ounds of interaction with\nLLMs. For example, as a ﬁrst step, we can instruct LLMs to solv e the problem directly\nYou will be provided with a math problem.

But we will see a r elatively more detailed dis-\ncussion on how to improve prompting through more reasoning i n Section 3.2.\n•Providing reference information . As discussed in the previous section, we can include\ndemonstrations in prompts and allow LLMs to in-context lear n from these demonstrations\nhow to perform the task. In fact, given the remarkable abilit y of language understanding of\nLLMs, we can add any type of text into the prompts and so these m odels can predict based\non enriched contexts. In many applications, we have various information that is relevant\nto user queries. Instead of using LLMs to make unconstrained predictions, we often want\nLLMs to produce outputs that are conﬁned to the relevant text . One such example is RAG,\nwhere the relevant text for the user query is provided by call ing an IR system, and we\nprompt LLMs to generate responses based on this provided rel evant text. The following\nprompt shows an example.\nYou are an expert that can generate answers to input queries. You have now\nbeen provided with a query and the corresponding context inf ormation.\nPlease generate an answer based on this context information . Note that\nyou need to provide the answer in your own words, not just copy from the\ncontext provided.\nContext information: {∗IR-result ∗}\nQuery: {∗query ∗}\nIf the context information is highly reliable, we can even re strict LLMs to answering using\nonly the provided text. An example prompt is shown as follows\n\n--- Page 112 ---\n\n3.1 General Prompt Design 105\nYou are an expert tasked with generating answers from input q ueries. You\nhave been provided with a query and corresponding context in formation,\norganized in a table where each row represents a useful recor d. Please\ngenerate an answer using only this context information. Ens ure that you\nprovide the answer in your own words.\nContext information: {∗table ∗}\nQuery: {∗query ∗}\nWhen dealing with real-world problems, we often have prior k nowledge and additional\ninformation about the problems that help produce better ans wers. Considering such infor-\nmation in prompting is generally helpful in improving the re sult.\n•Paying attention to prompt formats . In general, the performance of LLMs is highly\nsensitive to the prompts we input. Sometimes a small modiﬁca tion to a prompt can lead to a\nbig change in model output. An interesting example is that ch anging the order of sentences\nin a prompt may cause LLMs to generate different results. To m ake prompts easy to read\nand reduce ambiguity, it is common to format them in a way that ensures clarity. One\nexample is that we deﬁne several ﬁelds for prompts and ﬁll dif ferent information in each\nﬁeld. Another example is we can use code-style prompts for LL Ms which can understand\nand generate both natural language and code. See the followi ng for a code-style prompt that\nperforms translation where one demonstration is presented .\n[English] = [I have an apple.]\n[German] = [Ich habe einen Apfel.]\n[English] = [I have an orange.]\n[German] =\nLLMs can receive text in various formats. This allows us to us e control characters, XML\ntags, and speciﬁc formatting to represent complex data. And it is useful to specify how the\ninput and output should be formatted or structured. For exam ple, we can delimit sections of\ntext using quotes and prompt LLMs accordingly (e.g., adding a sentence like “the",

There are, of course,\nmany such methods, and one needs to develop their own through practice. Interested readers can\nrefer to various online documents for more information, suc h as OpenAI’s manual on the GPT\nseries models2.\n2See https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engi neering/\nsix-strategies-for-getting-better-results .\n\n--- Page 113 ---\n\n106 Prompting\n3.1.4 More Examples\nIn this subsection, we consider more examples of prompting L LMs to perform various NLP tasks.\nThe motivation here is not to give standard prompts for these tasks, but rather to use simple\nexamples to illustrate how LLMs can be prompted to deal with N LP problems.\n3.1.4.1 Text Classiﬁcation\nText classiﬁcation is perhaps one of the most common problem s in NLP. Many tasks can be\nbroadly categorized as assigning pre-deﬁned labels to a giv en text. Here we consider the polarity\nclassiﬁcation problem in sentiment analysis. We choose pol arity classiﬁcation for illustration be-\ncause it is one of the most popular and well-deﬁned text class iﬁcation tasks. In a general setup of\npolarity classiﬁcation, we are required to categorize a giv en text into one of three categories: neg-\native, positive, or neutral. Below is a simple prompt for doi ng this (for easy reading, we highlight\nthe task description in the prompt).\nAnalyze thepolarityofthefollowingtextandclassifyitaspositive, negative, or\nneutral.\nText:\nThe service at the restaurant was slower than expected, whic h was a bit frustrat-\ning.\nThe polarity of the text can be classiﬁed as positive.\nTo make the example complete, we show the response generated by the LLM (underlined text).\nAlthough the answer is correct, the LLM gives this answer not in labels but in text describing\nthe result. The problem is that LLMs are designed to generate text but not to assign labels to text\nand treat classiﬁcation problems as text generation proble ms. As a result, we need another system\nto map the LLM’s output to the label space (call it label mapping ), that is, we extract “positive”\nfrom “The polarity of the text can be classiﬁed as positive”. This is trivial in most cases because\nwe can identify label words via simple heuristics. But occas ionally, LLMs may not express the\nclassiﬁcation results using these label words. In this case , the problem becomes more complicated,\nas we need some way to map the generated text or words to predeﬁ ned label words.\nOne method to induce output labels from LLMs is to reframe the problem as a cloze task. For\nexample, the following shows a cloze-like prompt for polari ty classiﬁcation.\nAnalyze thepolarityofthefollowingtextandclassifyitaspositive, negative, or\nneutral.\nText:\nThe service at the restaurant was slower than expected, whic h was a bit frustrat-\ning.\nThe polarity of the text is positive\n\n--- Page 114 ---\n\n3.1 General Prompt Design 107\nWe can use LLMs to complete the text and ﬁll the blank with the m ost appropriate word. Ide-\nally, we wish the ﬁlled word would be positive ,negative , orneutral . However, LLMs are not\nguaranteed to generate these label words.

For example, when dealing with a large number of categories,\nit remains challenging to effectively prompt LLMs. Note tha t if we face a very difﬁcult classiﬁca-\ntion problem and have a certain amount of labeled data, ﬁne-t uning LLMs or adopting “BERT +\nclassiﬁer”-like architectures is also desirable.\n3.1.4.2 Information Extraction\nMany NLP problems can be regarded as information extraction problems, involving the identiﬁ-\ncation or extraction of speciﬁc pieces of information from u nstructured text.

These p roblems can be roughly categorized\ninto two classes: 1) continual writing based on the input tex t (call it text completion ), and 2)\ntransformation of the input text into another text (call it text transformation ). Here, we illustrate\nthe prompts for the former and consider the prompts for the la tter in the following discussion.\n\n--- Page 118 ---\n\n3.1 General Prompt Design 111\nA simple example of text completion is continuing to write a s tory starting with a few given\nsentences.\nYou areawriter who isgreat atwritingstories.

The\nrequirements can include style, tone, length, and any speci ﬁc content that the text should contain.\nFor example, users may need a formal report, a creative story , or a piece of programming code.\nHere is a prompt for generating a ﬁve-character regulated Ch inese poem.\n\n--- Page 119 ---\n\n112 Prompting\nYouareapoet.

P rompt templates for general-purpose\nquestion answering can be:\n{∗question ∗}\nQuestion: {∗question ∗}\nAnswer:\nQuestion answering is important in NLP because many problem s can be framed as question-\nanswering tasks. In particular, many recent reasoning task s are deﬁned in the form of question\nanswering. For example, in the MMLU benchmark [ Hendrycks et al. ,2021 ], each example con-\nsists of a multiple-choice question, and LLMs are required t o select the correct answer. See the\nfollowing for an example prompt for answering a question in t his dataset.\n\n--- Page 121 ---\n\n114 Prompting\n(Z,∗)is a group with a∗b=a+b+ 1for alla,binZ.

For each probl em, we use LLMs to return a\nsolution in natural language. For example, the following is a prompt used for solving a problem\nin GSM8K.\nDEMO Q: Jerry’s two daughters play softball on different teams. T hey each have\n8 games this season.

CoT methods provide a simple way\nto prompt LLMs to generate step-by-step reasoning for compl ex problems, thereby approaching\ntasks in a more human-like manner. Rather than coming to a con clusion directly, the CoT methods\ninstruct LLMs to generate reasoning steps or to learn from de monstrations of detailed reasoning\nprocesses provided in the prompts. To illustrate CoT, we con sider the problem of algebraic calcu-\nlation, as commonly described in the literature. Suppose we are given a algebraic problem\nCalculate the average of the numbers 2, 4, and 6.\nWe can consider it as the question and prompt an LLM to answer i t.\nQ: Please calculate the average of the numbers 2,4, and 9.\nA: The answer is 6.\nIt seems difﬁcult for the LLM to directly give a correct answe r.

By providing a detailed reasoning process for\na similar problem, the LLM learns to reason and thereby gener ates a problem-solving path that\nleads to the correct answer.\nThere are several beneﬁts of using CoT prompting. First, CoT allows LLMs to decom-\npose complex problems into smaller, sequential reasoning s teps. This somewhat mirrors human\nproblem-solving behaviors, making it particularly effect ive for tasks requiring detailed, multi-step\nreasoning. Second, CoT makes the reasoning process more tra nsparent and interpretable. Since all\nreasoning steps are visible, we can understand and interpre t how a conclusion was reached. Third,\nif users can follow the logic behind the reasoning process, t hey will be more likely to trust the pre-\ndictions of an LLM. This is particularly important when appl ying LLMs in ﬁelds like medicine,\neducation, and ﬁnance. Fourth, CoT is an in-context learnin g approach, and thus, it is applicable\nto most well-trained, off-the-shelf LLMs. Moreover, CoT pr ovides efﬁcient ways to adapt LLMs\nto different types of problems. It can even inspire more crea tive solutions by exploring various\nalternative reasoning paths, which might not be obvious whe n arriving at a conclusion directly.\nThe method described above requires providing one or more ex amples of CoT reasoning, typ-\nically called the few-shot CoT method. By contrast, the zero -shot CoT method does not require\nsuch examples. It instead prompts LLMs to reason step-by-st ep by incorporating speciﬁc instruc-\ntions in prompts. For example, below is a zero-shot CoT promp t.\nQ: Please calculate the average of the numbers 2,4, and 9.\nA:Let’s think step-by-step.\nWe have three numbers: 2,4,and 9.Add these numbers together,\n2 + 4 + 9 = 15 .Determine how many numbers there are, which inthiscase\n",

As discussed in Kojima et al. [2022 ]’s work, prompting with such instructions\nmay result in LLMs generating only the reasoning steps witho ut a clear conclusion. In this case,\na second round of prompting can be used to extract the answer f rom these reasoning steps. For\nexample, Kojima et al. [2022 ] create a second prompt which combines both the input and out put\n\n--- Page 124 ---\n\n3.2 Advanced Prompting Methods 117\nin the ﬁrst round of prompting. Using this combined input, th e LLM can continue its reasoning\nprocess and then generate the correct answer. Furthermore, it is possible to prompt LLMs to\nreason using instructions other than “Let’s think step by st ep”, such as “Let’s think logically” and\n“Please show me your thinking steps ﬁrst”.\nWhile we have illustrated CoT methods using an algebraic rea soning problem, these methods\ncan be applied to a variety of different problems. Typical pr oblem-solving scenarios for CoT\ninclude mathematical reasoning, logical reasoning, commo nsense reasoning, symbolic reasoning,\ncode generation, and so on. See Figure 3.1for more examples of applying CoT in various tasks.\nCoT today is one of the most active ﬁelds of prompt engineerin g. This has not only led to im-\nproved performance for LLM prompting but has opened the door to a wide range of methods for\nstudying and verifying reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Alt hough we have focused on the basic\nidea of CoT in this section, it can be improved in several ways . For example, we can consider the\nreasoning process as a problem of searching through many pos sible paths, each of which may con-\nsist of multiple intermediate states (i.e., reasoning step s). In general, we wish the search space to\nbe well-deﬁned and sufﬁciently large, so that we are more lik ely to ﬁnd the optimal result. For this\nreason, an area of current LLM research is aimed at designing better structures for representing\nreasoning processes, allowing LLMs to tackle more complex r easoning challenges. These struc-\ntures include tree-based structures [ Yao et al. ,2024 ], graph-based structures [ Besta et al. ,2024 ],\nand so on. By using these compact representations of reasoni ng paths, LLMs can explore a wider\nrange of decision-making paths, analogous to System 2 think ing5. Another line of research fo-\ncuses on prompting LLMs with multi-round interactions. Thi s involves decomposing complex\nproblems into sub-problems, verifying and reﬁning model ou tputs, employing model ensembling,\nand so on. Note that these methods and the issues involved are not limited to CoT. In fact, they\nare often used as more general approaches to improving LLMs, while CoT can be seen as a way\nto test the capabilities of LLMs. We will see discussions of s ome of these issues in the following\nsubsections.\nBefore leaving our discussion of CoT, we should consider its practical limitations.

System 2 is slow, deliberate, and\nanalytical.

However, it is often advantageous to employ strategies that decompose the problem, thereby\nmaking it easier to tackle the corresponding sub-problems w ith less effort. For example, consider\nwriting a blog about the risks of AI. If we simply prompt an LLM with the instruction “Please\nwrite a blog about the risks of AI”, the LLM may generate a blog with arbitrary structures and\n6A relatively formal deﬁnition can be found in Frensch and Funke [2014 ]’s book: complex problem-solving occurs\nto overcome barriers between a given state and a desired goal state by means of behavioral and/or cognitive, multi-step\nactivities .\n\n--- Page 126 ---\n\n3.2 Advanced Prompting Methods 119\nwriting styles.

While\nproblem decomposition can be applied to various NLP problem s, it has been more extensively\ndiscussed and tested in reasoning tasks recently. For compl ex reasoning tasks, we often need\na multi-step reasoning path to reach a correct conclusion. W e can use LLMs to achieve this in\nthree different ways. First, LLMs can directly reach the con clusion. In other words, they can\npredict without explicit reasoning processes, and there is a hidden and uninterpretable reasoning\nmechanism. Second, LLMs are prompted to generate a multi-st ep reasoning path that leads to the\nconclusion, like CoT. However, we run LLMs just once, and all intermediate steps in reasoning\nare generated in a single prediction. Third, we break down th e original problem into a number of\nsub-problems, which are either addressed in separate runs o f LLMs or tackled using other systems.\nHere we focus our attention on the third approach, which is cl osely related to problem decompo-\nsition. Note, however, that a more comprehensive discussio n could cover all these approaches,\nwhile the ﬁrst two have been discussed to some extent in this c hapter.\nA general framework for problem decomposition involves two elements.\n•Sub-problem Generation . This involves decomposing the input problem into a number o f\nsub-problems.\n•Sub-problem Solving . This involves solving each sub-problem and deriving inter mediate\nand ﬁnal conclusions through reasoning.\nThese two issues can be modeled in different ways, leading to various problem decomposition\nmethods. One approach is to treat them as separate steps in a t wo-step process. For example,\nconsider the blog writing task described at the beginning of this subsection. In the ﬁrst step, we\ndecompose the entire problem into sub-problems all at once ( i.e., outline the blog). In the second\nstep, we solve the sub-problems either sequentially or in an other order (i.e., ﬁll in content for\neach section as needed). The ﬁnal output of this process comb ines the results from solving each\nsub-problem. While this method is simple and straightforwa rd, it assumes that the problem is\ncompositional, making it more suitable for tasks like writi ng and code generation.\nHowever, many real-world problems require complex reasoni ng. One key characteristic of\nthese problems is that the reasoning steps may not be ﬁxed. Th e reasoning path can vary for\ndifferent problems, and each step of reasoning may depend on the outcomes of prior steps. In\n\n--- Page 128 ---\n\n3.2 Advanced Prompting Methods 121\nsuch cases, it is undesirable to use ﬁxed sub-problem genera tion in advance. Instead, sub-problems\nshould be generated dynamically based on the input problem, and, if possible, generated on the\nﬂy during the reasoning process.

A s traightforward way to achieve this\nis to adapt an LLM for these tasks by either prompting or tunin g the model.\nHere we consider a method based on the above idea, called least-to-most prompting [Zhou et al. ,\n2023b ]. The motivation for this method arises from the challenges of solving difﬁcult reasoning\nproblems — those that cannot be addressed by simply generali zing from a few examples. For\nthese problems, a more effective problem-solving strategy is to follow a progressive sequence of\nsub-problems that systematically lead to the conclusion. M ore speciﬁcally, in the least-to-most\nprompting method, sub-problem generation is performed by p rompting an LLM with instructions\nand/or demonstrations. For example, below is a 2-shot promp t for sub-problem generation in\nleast-to-most prompting.\nTASK Your task is to decompose a problem into several sub-problem s. You will\nbe given a few examples to illustrate how to achieve this.\nDEMO Q: In a community, 5% of the population are infants, 15% are ch ildren,\n40% are adults, and 40% are seniors. Which group makes up the l argest\nportion of the population?\nA: To answer the question “Which group makes up the largest po rtion of the\npopulation?”, we need to know: “ How many percent areinfants?”, “ How\nmany percent arechildren?”, “ How many percent areadults?”, “ How many\npercent areseniors?”.\nQ: Alice, Bob, and Charlie brought beads for their group proj ect in their\ncraft class. Alice has twice as many beads as Bob, and Bob has ﬁ ve times\nas many beads as Charlie. If Charlie has 6 beads, how many bead s can they\nuse for their craft project?\nA: To answer the question “How many beads can they use for thei r craft\nproject?”, we need to know: “ How many beads does Bob have?”, “ How\nmany beads does Alicehave?”.\nUSER Q: The environmental study conducted from 2015 to 2020 revea led that the\naverage temperature in the region increased by 2.3 degrees C elsius. What\nwas the duration of the environmental study?\nA: To answer the question “ What wasthedurationoftheenvironmental\nstudy?”, we need to know: “ When didtheenvironmentalstudy start?”,\n“When didtheenvironmentalstudy end?”.\nBy learning from the examples, the LLM can generate two sub-p roblems for answering the\nnew problem “What was the duration of the environmental stud y?” (highlighted in blue and\norange). Given these sub-problems, we solve them sequentia lly. For each sub-problem, we take\nall previously-generated QA pairs as context, and then prod uce the answer.

We can improve it in several ways. One simple improvement is to apply\nvarious advanced prompting techniques, which do not requir e changes to the problem decom-\nposition framework. For example, we can incorporate CoT int o the prompting to enhance the\nreasoning performance of sub-problem generation and solvi ng.\nAnother improvement is to explore methods for better decomp osing problems and organizing\nproblem-solving paths. To describe these approaches, we wi ll use the symbol p0to denote the\n\n--- Page 130 ---\n\n3.2 Advanced Prompting Methods 123\ninput problem, and use the symbols {p1,...,p n}to denote the sub-problems corresponding to p0.\nFor least-to-most prompting, we decompose p0into{p1,...,p n}, given by\n{p1,...,p n}=G(p0) (3.2)\nwhereG(·)denotes the function of sub-problem generation. Then, we so lve the sub-problems\n{p1,...,p n}sequentially, resulting in a sequence of answers {a1,...,a n}. For answering the i-th\nsub-problem pi, we include both the original problem p0and all previously-seen problem-answer\npairs in the context for prediction. The answer aiis given by\nai=Si(pi,{p0,p<i,a<i}) (3.3)\nwherep<i={p1,...,p i−1}anda<i={a1,...,a i−1}.Si(·)denotes the function that solves the\nsub-problem pigiven the context {p0,p<i,a<i}. The last step is to generate the answer to the\noriginal problem p0, which can be expressed in a similar manner to Eq. ( 3.3).\na0=S0(p0,{p≤n,a≤n}) (3.4)\nOne way to reﬁne this model is to modify the G(·)function so that the model can dynamically\ngenerate answers. Instead of generating all sub-problems a t one time, we can generate each of\nthem during problem-solving [ Dua et al. ,2022 ]. To do this, we can replace Eq. ( 3.2) with\npi=Gi(p0,{p<i,a<i}) (3.5)\nHence we obtain a sub-problem generation model that operate s in a step-by-step manner. At each\nstepi, we ﬁrst generate the sub-problem piby prompting an LLM with the original problem p0\nand the problem-solving history {p<i,a<i}. We then generate the answer aifor this sub-problem\nusing the same or a different LLM, based on the same contextua l information (see Eq. ( 3.3)).

In fact, we can expand this function to any system that is cap able of addressing the sub-\nproblem.

For example, Si(·)can be deﬁned as a recursive program that\ngenerates and solves sub-problems. This incorporates recu rsion into problem-solving and allows\nus to address problems by iteratively decomposing them. As a result, we can deﬁne a hierarchical\nstructure for problem-solving [ Khot et al. ,2023 ].\nIf we generalize the above formulation a bit further, we can c onsider it as a reinforcement\nlearning problem. A typical method is to model a problem-sol ving process as a decision making\nprocess. In each step of this process, an action is taken base d on the current state. These actions\n\n--- Page 131 ---\n\n124 Prompting\ncan include all functions for sub-problem generation and so lving (i.e.,Gi(·)andSi(·)). Thus,\nthe action sequence corresponds to a problem-solving path. Since the discussion of reinforcement\nlearning problems is beyond the scope of this chapter, we ski p the precise description of this\nlearning task. Nevertheless, developing an agent or contro ller to determine when and how to\ngenerate and solve a sub-problem is also a natural choice.\nIn NLP, problem decomposition is related to a long line of res earch on multi-hop question\nanswering [ Mavi et al. ,2024 ]. This task requires the system to gather and combine inform ation\nfrom multiple pieces of text to provide an accurate answer to a complex question. For example,\nto answer the question “What is the capital of the country whe re Albert Einstein was born?”, we\nneed to know “Where Albert Einstein was born?” and “What’s th e capital of Germany?”. Earlier\nwork in this area and related ones has investigated the issue of problem decomposition, though the\nmethods might not be based on LLMs. For example, a popular met hod is to develop an additional\nneural model to generate simpler questions that address dif ferent aspects of the original question\n[Andreas et al. ,2016 ;Talmor and Berant ,2018 ;Min et al. ,2019 ]. This question generator can\ncreate questions in a batch or sequential manner.\nBroadly speaking, problem decomposition is also related to the compositionality issue in NLP\n[Drozdov et al. ,2022 ;Press et al. ,2023 ]. For example, in semantic parsing, we map natural lan-\nguage sentences into structured meaning representations b y breaking them down into constituent\nparts and understanding the sentences based on the meanings of these parts and the rules used to\ncombine them. In early studies of this ﬁeld, highly composit ional sentences were considered easier\nfor testing systems, as it is relatively straightforward to decompose such sentences and compose\nthe meanings of their parts.

However, the task becomes much m ore difﬁcult when more gener-\nalization is required for modeling compositionality in new data. In this case, we want systems\nto have improved abilities of compositional generalization . In more recent research on LLMs,\nthis issue has been frequently discussed in compositional r easoning tasks, such as SCAN7, as it\nis considered an important aspect of testing the language un derstanding and reasoning abilities\nof LLMs. This also presents new tasks for developing and exam ining problem decomposition\nmethods.\nIn LLMs, one interesting application of problem decomposit ion is tool use. In some cases,\nit is necessary to integrate external tools into LLMs to acce ss accurate data not available during\ntraining or ﬁne-tuning. For example, LLMs can integrate wit h APIs to fetch real-time data such\nas weather updates, stock market prices, or news feeds, enab ling them to provide up-to-date re-\nsponses to user queries. When using tools, LLM predictions m ight include markers that indicate\nwhere and how to call external APIs. This requires decomposi ng the problem into sub-problems,\nwith some handled by the LLMs and others by external tools. Mo re detailed discussions on this\ntopic will be presented in Section 3.2.5 .\n3.2.3 Self-reﬁnement\nIn many cases, predictions of LLMs can be inaccurate or incor rect. Given that current LLMs can\nperform tasks like reﬁnement and correction, it makes sense to explore methods for these models\nto self-reﬁne their outputs. Self-reﬁnement is a common phe nomenon in human psychological\n7The SCAN tasks (Simpliﬁed versions of the CommAI Navigation tasks) are designed to evaluate the ability of\nLLMs to perform compositional generalization [ Lake and Baroni ,2018 ]. They involve translating natural language\ncommands into a sequence of actions. For example, a command “ jump opposite left and walk thrice” can be translated\ninto the action sequence “LTURN LTURN JUMP WALK WALK WALK”.\n\n--- Page 132 ---\n\n3.2 Advanced Prompting Methods 125\nactivities and daily behavior. For example, when designing a product, a designer might ﬁrst create\na basic prototype, then reﬁne the design after evaluation an d testing to enhance user experience\nand functionality. The reﬁnement can be iterated several ti mes until the design is satisfactory. The\nidea of predict-then-reﬁne can also be found in NLP. One earl y example is Brill’s tagger [ Brill,\n1992 ], where an initial POS tagging result of a sentence can be ite ratively reﬁned using a rule-\nbased system.

In a broader\nsense, improving LLMs for self-reﬁnement tasks can be seen a s an alignment issue. For example,\nit has been found that some self-correction abilities can be activated through RLHF [ Ganguli et al. ,\n2023 ]. However, discussing these issues is beyond the scope of th is chapter. Further discussion\ncan be found in Chapter 4.\nIn LLMs, self-reﬁnement is related to several concepts that reveal the psychological aspects\nof these models, such as the ability to self-reﬂect. A view is that if LLMs are capable of self-\nreﬂection, their predictions can become more accurate and e ven possess self-correcting capabili-\nties. This self-reﬂection can be activated in various ways, for example, by prompting these LLMs\nto engage in more in-depth and careful thinking, or by provid ing examples from which the models\ncan learn and reﬂect. To illustrate, we consider here the deliberate-then-generate (DTG ) method\npresented in Li et al. [2023a ]’s work, where LLMs are prompted to deliberate. In DTG, we ar e\ngiven an initial model output which may contain errors. LLMs are then prompted to identify the\nerror types of this model output and provide an improved outp ut. Below is a template of DTG\nprompting for Chinse-to-English translation tasks.\n\n--- Page 136 ---\n\n3.2 Advanced Prompting Methods 129\nGiven the Chinese sentence: {∗source ∗}\nThe English translation is: {∗target ∗}\nPlease ﬁrst detect the type of error, and then reﬁne the trans lation.\nError Type:\nWe aim to ﬁrst predict the error type (red), and then produce a reﬁned translation (blue). This\nprocess of deliberation is guided by the instruction “Pleas e ﬁrst detect the type of error, and then\nreﬁne the translation”. It encourages LLMs to initially eng age in thoughtful analysis and then give\nbetter results. Since error type prediction and reﬁnement a re performed in a single run of LLMs,\nthis method incorporates both steps of feedback and reﬁneme nt into one process.\nIn the above prompts, we assume that the LLM we use is able to re view the input translation\nand correctly identify its error types. However, this raise s new difﬁculties as the model may not\nbe good at ﬁnding errors in translations. This will in turn re sult in extra ﬁne-tuning or prompt-\ning engineering efforts. So a simpler method is to reduce the burden of error identiﬁcation and\nuse LLMs for deliberation only. To do this, we can replace the input translation with a random\ntranslation and assign a default error type. An example of su ch a prompt is shown below.\nGiven the Chinese sentence:\n一系列考古发现奠定红山文化在中华文明起源研究中的重要地位。\nThe English translation is:\nAvarietyofinnovativetechniques have redeﬁned theimportance ofmodernart\nincontemporary cultural studies.\nPlease ﬁrst detect the type of error, and then reﬁne the trans lation.\nError Type: IncorrectTrans lation\nIn this example, the input translation is not generated by LL Ms but is instead randomly sam-\npled from the dataset. So it is simply an incorrect translati on for the source sentence, and we can\nset the error type accordingly.

Nevertheless,\nthis method does not rely on any feedback and can enhance the p erformance of a single LLM\nprediction via simple prompting.\nNote that while DTG is non-iterative, iterative learning an d reﬁnement are commonly used\nin NLP. An advantage of these iterative approaches are that t hey mimics human learning and\nproblem-solving, where continuous feedback and adjustmen ts lead to progressively improved out-\ncomes. Iterative methods can be applied to a range of LLM prom pting problems. For example, in\nproblem decomposition, one can incorporate new sub-proble ms and their solutions into the con-\ntext at each step, and thus LLMs can progressively approach t he solution of the original problem.\n\n--- Page 137 ---\n\n130 Prompting\nOn the other hand, iterative methods raise several issues th at are absent in non-iterative meth-\nods, for example, errors in earlier steps may negatively imp act subsequent problem-solving, and\ndetermining when to stop iterating often requires addition al engineering effort.\n3.2.4 Ensembling\nModel ensembling for text generation has been extensively d iscussed in the NLP literature. The\nidea is to combine the predictions of two or more models to gen erate a better prediction. This\ntechnique can be directly applicable to LLMs. For example, w e can collect a set of LLMs and run\neach of them on the same input. The ﬁnal output is a combined pr ediction from these models.\nFor LLM prompting, it is also possible to improve performanc e by combining predictions\nbased on different prompts. Suppose we have an LLM and a colle ction of prompts that address\nthe same task. We can run this LLM with each of the prompts and t hen combine the predictions.\nFor example, below are three different prompt templates for text simpliﬁcation.\nMake this text simpler.\n{∗text∗}\nCondense and simplify this text.\n{∗text∗}\nRewrite for easy reading.\n{∗text∗}\nEach of these prompts will lead to a different prediction, an d we can consider all three predictions\nto generate the ﬁnal one.\nFormally, let {x1,...,xK}beKprompts for performing the same task. Given an LLM Pr(·|·),\nwe can ﬁnd the best prediction for each xiusing ˆyi= arg maxyiPr(yi|xi). These predictions\ncan be combined to form a “new” prediction:\nˆy= Combine(ˆ y1,...,ˆyK) (3.6)\nHere Combine( ·)is the combination model, which can be designed in several di fferent ways. For\nexample, we can select the best prediction by voting or by ide ntifying the one that overlaps the\nmost with others. Another method for model combination is to perform model averaging during\ntoken prediction. Let ˆyjbe the predicted token at the j-th step for model combination. The\n\n--- Page 138 ---\n\n3.2 Advanced Prompting Methods 131\nprobability of predicting ˆyjis given by\nˆyj= arg max\nyjK∑\nk=1log Pr(yj|xk,ˆy1,...,ˆyj−1) (3.7)\nIn ensembling for LLM prompting, it is generally advantageo us to use diverse prompts so that\nthe combination can capture a broader range of potential res ponses.

Another method for model combination is to perform model averaging during\ntoken prediction. Let ˆyjbe the predicted token at the j-th step for model combination.

This practice is common in\nensemble learning, as diversity helps average out biases an d errors that may be speciﬁc to any\nsingle model or conﬁguration. From the Bayesian viewpoint, we can treat the prompt xas a latent\nvariable, given the problem of interest, p. This allows the predictive distribution of ygivenpto\nbe written as the distribution Pr(y|x)marginalized over all possible prompts\nPr(y|p) =∫\nPr(y|x) Pr(x|p)dx (3.8)\nThe integral computes the total probability of yby considering all possible values of x, weighted\nby their likelihoods given p. Here Pr(y|x)is given by the LLM, and Pr(x|p)is the prior distri-\nbution of prompts for the problem. This is a good model becaus e the integral effectively accounts\nfor the uncertainty in the choice of x, ensuring that the ﬁnal predictive distribution Pr(y|p)is\nrobust and encompasses all potential variations and biases in the prompts. However, computing\nthis integral directly can be computationally infeasible d ue to the potentially inﬁnite space of x.\nOne approach to addressing this issue is to employ methods li ke Monte Carlo sampling, which\napproximate the integral using a manageable, ﬁnite number o f prompts.\nWhile the Bayesian treatment is mathematically well-deﬁne d, it is common practice in NLP\nto assume a non-informative or uniform prior and focus inste ad on constructing a set of diverse\nprompts. Consequently, the output can be computed using a st raightforward combination model,\nas described in Eq. ( 3.6). The issue of creating high-quality, diverse prompts has b een studied in\nCoT and other in-context learning areas. Most of the researc h focuses on incorporating a variety\nof demonstration examples across different prompts. Here, we list some of these methods.\n• Given a problem, we manually create a number of demonstrati ons and use different ones\nfor different prompts.\n• Given a problem, we use LLMs to automatically generate demo nstrations and prompts.\n• Given a prompt, we create different prompts by changing the order of demonstrations in the\nprompt.\n• Given a prompt, we use LLMs to generate a number of similar pr ompts.\n• Given a prompt, we transform it into other forms, e.g., tran slating it into other languages.\nOf course, in practice, we can combine these methods to achie ve greater diversity. An underly-\ning assumption here is that diverse prompts can lead to diver se model outputs. This is particularly\nthe case when the problem we deal with is relatively new and di fﬁcult. For stronger and more ro-\nbust LLMs, the variance in output for similar prompts might n ot be large. In this case, the beneﬁt\nof involving multiple prompts can be modest.\n\n--- Page 139 ---\n\n132 Prompting\nIn addition to providing diverse prompts for LLMs, another a pproach is to make use of the\ninherent variance in the outputs of LLMs. One simple way to ge nerate multiple outputs is to\nsample outputs from the hypothesis space. This is straightf orward for LLMs because their search\nalgorithms are naturally suited to producing multiple resu lts. For example, if beam search is\nused, we can easily collect all the complete hypotheses in th e beam to generate multiple output\ncandidates. Also, we can modify the search algorithms to imp lement more powerful sampling\nmethods and explore a wider range of high-quality hypothese s.\nThe next question is how to combine diverse model prediction s. This leads us back to the\nmodel combination issue as described in Eq. ( 3.6).

Since the prompt and the model are ﬁxed in this metho d, it is not strictly a prompt\nensembling method. Instead, it can be seen as an instance of o utput ensembling methods, also\nknown as hypothesis selection methods, which have long been explored in NLP, particularly for\ntext generation problems [ Xiao et al. ,2013 ]. In these methods, multiple outputs are generated by\nvarying model architectures or parameters. Each output is t hen assigned a score by some criterion,\nand the outputs are re-ranked based on these scores. There ar e various ways to deﬁne the scoring\nfunction, such as measuring the agreement between an output and others, and using a stronger\nmodel to rescore each output8. Figure 3.2shows a comparison of different ensembling methods\nfor LLMs.\nNow, let us brieﬂy review the methods we have discussed so far in this section, such as problem\ndecomposition and self-reﬁnement. It is apparent that thes e methods enhance decision-making by\nintroducing more “choices” into the reasoning process. To s ome extent, they all involve evalu-\nating and providing feedback on the results of LLMs. For exam ple, in self-reﬁnement, we need\nto offer suggestions for improving the prediction of LLMs, a nd in output ensembling, we select\nthe optimal output from a pool of candidates. In this sense, t hese methods fall under the broader\ncategory of predict-then-verify approaches, where predic tions are initially made, then veriﬁed and\nreﬁned. The fundamental problem here involves verifying an d evaluating the reasoning results\nor intermediate steps. This issue is somewhat related to the problem of training reward models\nin RLHF, although RLHF addresses a different aspect. In fact , the development of veriﬁers has\nbeen explored and implemented in reasoning with LLMs. Most w ork, rather than developing\nheuristic-based inference-time algorithms, focuses on le arning veriﬁers in a supervised manner. A\nstraightforward method is to train veriﬁers as binary class iﬁers, such as classifying an answer as\n8An interpretation of self-consistency is to view it as a mini mum Bayes risk search process. It searches for the best\noutput by minimizing the Bayes risk. More speciﬁcally, a ris k functionR(y,yr)is deﬁned on each pair of outputs\n(denoted by (y,yr)), representing the cost of replacing ywith yr. Given a set of outputs Ω, the risk of an output\ny∈Ωis given by\nRisk( y) =Eyr∼Pr(yr|x)R(y,yr)\n=∑\nyr∈ΩR(y,yr)·Pr(yr|x) (3.9)\n\n--- Page 141 ---\n\n134 Prompting\nLLM2\nLLM1LLM2\nPrompt Prediction2\nPrediction1Prediction3Combine/Select\nFinal\nPrediction\n(a) Model Ensembling\nLLM Prompt2\nPrompt1Prompt3\nPrediction2\nPrediction1Prediction3Combine/Select\nFinal\nPrediction\n(b) Prompt Ensembling\nLLM Prompt Prediction2\nPrediction1Prediction3Combine/Select\nFinal\nPredictionSample\n(c) Output Ensembling\nFig. 3.2: Ensembling methods for LLMs. In standard model ensembling ( a), multiple LLMs varying in architectures or\nparameters are used.

By drawing fro m external databases and documents,\n\n--- Page 142 ---\n\n3.2 Advanced Prompting Methods 135\nRAG can signiﬁcantly improve the quality of responses, ensu ring they are both contextually rel-\nevant and factually correct. Such an approach is particular ly useful in scenarios that require high\nfactual accuracy and up-to-date information, such as compl ex question answering.\nThe concept of RAG has been mentioned several times in the pre vious sections and chapters.\nFor completeness, we outline the key steps involved in RAG he re.\n• We prepare a collection of texts which are treated as an addi tional source of knowledge we\ncan access.\n• We retrieve relevant texts for a given query.\n• We input both the retrieved texts and the query into an LLM, w hich is then prompted to\nproduce the ﬁnal prediction.\nSteps 1 and 2 can be implemented by using an external informat ion retrieval system. For\nexample, we can store the collection of texts in a vector data base and then retrieve the most similar\ntexts through vector-based search techniques. Since infor mation retrieval is not the focus of this\nchapter, we will assume that such systems are available off- the-shelf and use them directly.\nHere we present how to prompt LLMs to make use of retrieved tex ts.

In\nmany cases, we need to control how much we depend on the retrie ved context to make predictions.\nSometimes, LLMs must derive responses strictly from the pro vided texts, while at other times,\nthey may need to generate responses using their pre-trained knowledge if the provided texts are\ninsufﬁcient. There are many aspects of RAG, such as improvem ents to the retrieval systems, that\ncannot be covered in this chapter. Interested readers can re fer to surveys of RAG techniques for\nmore information [ Li et al. ,2022 ;Gao et al. ,2023c ].\nOne reason we discuss RAG here is that it can be broadly regard ed as an instance of the\ngeneral problem decomposition framework (see Section 3.2.2 ). RAG divides problem-solving\ninto two steps. In the ﬁrst step, we collect relevant and supp orting information for a given query\nfrom various knowledge sources. In the second step, we use LL Ms to generate responses based\non the collected information. If we extend the concept of pro blem decomposition further, we\nwill ﬁnd that many tasks requiring the use of external system s or tools can be treated as similar\nproblems. One such example is tool use in LLMs. In many applic ations, LLMs need to employ\nexternal databases, APIs, and even simulation tools to gene rate accurate responses. For example,\nLLMs can access real-time data from ﬁnancial markets to prov ide up-to-date investment advice or\nintegrate with healthcare databases to offer personalized medical insights. This integration extends\nthe capabilities of LLMs by allowing them to interact with, a nd in some contexts, inﬂuence or\ncontrol external systems. Consequently, LLMs function mor e asautonomous agents rather than\nmere text generators [ Franklin and Graesser ,1996 ].\nThe issue of tool use is broad and vast. Here we narrow our disc ussion to tasks that can be fa-\ncilitated by calling external APIs to solve some of the sub-p roblems [ Parisi et al. ,2022 ;Gao et al. ,\n2023b ]. Consider again the example of asking an LLM to answer “Wher e will the 2028 Olympics\nbe held?”. Suppose the LLM can access a web search tool. We can then prompt the LLM to\nanswer the question with web search, like this\nYour task is to answer the following question. You may use ext ernal tools, such\nas web search, to assist you.\nQuestion:\nWhere will the 2028 Olympics be held?\nThe information regarding this question is given as follows :\n{tool: web-search, query: \"2028 Olympics\"}\nSo the answer is: Los Angeles\nHere {tool: web-search, query: \"2028 Olympics\"} indicates a request to the web search\nsystem using the query “2028 Olympics”. When the LLM sees thi s string, it executes a web search\nand uses the result to replace the string. Then, in subsequen t steps of prediction, the LLM uses\nthis web search result as context to produce the correct answ er.\nConsider another example where we ask the LLM to solve a mathe matical problem.\n\n--- Page 145 ---\n\n138 Prompting\nProblem:\nA swimming pool needs to be ﬁlled with water. The pool measure s 10 meters\nin length, 4 meters in width, and 2 meters in depth. Calculate the volume of the\npool in cubic meters and then determine how many liters of wat er are needed to\nﬁll it (considering 1 cubic meter equals 1000 liters).\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, the LLM needs to ﬁrst calculate the vol ume of the\npool by using the formula for the volume of a rectangular pris m: Length ×\nWidth ×Depth.Therefore, The volume is 10m×4m×2m={tool:\ncalculator, expres sion: 10*4*2}m3. Next, to ﬁnd out how\nmany liters of water are needed, the LLM multiplies the volum e in cubic\nmeters by 1000 (since 1 cubic meter equals 1000 liters). Thus ,80×1000\n={tool: calculator, expres sion: 80*1000} liters.\nHere the string {tool: calculator, expression: 10 * 4 * 2} triggers the invocation\nof a mathematical interpreter to calculate the result of the expression.

In contrast, in RAG,\nthe retrieved texts are provided before the prediction proc ess begins. However, from the language\nmodeling perspective, they are actually doing the same thin g: before generating the ﬁnal result,\nwe use external tools, either manually or automatically, to obtain sufﬁcient and relevant context. A\nhigh-level interpretation of these approaches is that they both rely on an “agent” that can determine\nwhere and how to call external functions to generate the cont ext necessary for prediction.\nAn issue with tool use is that the original LLMs are not traine d to generate the necessary\nmarkers for tool use. Therefore, we need to ﬁne-tune the LLMs to adapt them for these tasks\n[Schick et al. ,2024 ]. As this chapter focuses on prompting, we will not present t he details of this\nﬁne-tuning process. To put it simply, we ﬁrst need to annotat e data. For each ﬁne-tuning example,\nwe replace parts of the output that require the use of externa l tools with predeﬁned commands\nor markers. Then, we use this labeled data to ﬁne-tune the par ameters of the LLM as usual. As\na result, the LLM can gain the ability to generate commands fo r calling external tools. During\ninference, we can execute these tool use commands in the mode l outputs to get assistance from\nexternal tools.\n3.3 Learning to Prompt\nSo far in this chapter, we have considered several basic prom pting strategies and various reﬁne-\nments to them. However, all the prompts we have discussed wer e designed manually. This leads\nto a number of problems: First, designing high-quality prom pts is inherently difﬁcult and requires\nsubstantial manual effort. For example, extensive experim entation with different prompts is often\nneeded to identify the most effective ones. Since different LLMs may respond better to certain\n\n--- Page 146 ---\n\n3.3 Learning to Prompt 139\ntypes of prompts, developing universally effective prompt s can be even more resource-intensive.\nSecond, manual prompt design relies heavily on human expert ise, which can limit the diversity\nof approaches and overlook potentially effective prompts t hat are not immediately obvious to hu-\nmans. Third, prompts created by humans can be complex and red undant, leading to longer inputs\nfor LLMs and higher computational costs.\nIn this section, we discuss techniques for automated prompt ing. These methods aim to auto-\nmatically create, optimize, and represent prompts so that t he downstream tasks can be addressed\nmore effectively and efﬁciently. In particular, we conside r three issues here.\n• How can we automate the process of designing and optimizing prompts for LLMs?\n• Are there other forms of representing prompts beyond strin gs, and how can we learn such\nrepresentations?\n• How can we make prompts more concise and compact, thereby re ducing their complexity\nand length?\nNote that there are many settings in which we can investigate these issues. For example, we\nmight specify that prompts are developed speciﬁcally for a p articular LLM, or that the develop-\nment is independent of the LLM used. These settings can lead t o different methods and application\nscenarios, but these methods may overlap in some ways.

These settings can lead t o different methods and application\nscenarios, but these methods may overlap in some ways. In the following discussion, we will cover\nseveral different scenarios and discuss the connections be tween various methods.\n3.3.1 Prompt Optimization\nGiven that prompt design is difﬁcult and labor-intensive, i t is desirable to use machine learning\nmodels to discover the optimal prompt for a speciﬁc task (cal l itautomatic prompt design or\nprompt optimization ). This approach can broadly be regarded as an instance of automated ma-\nchine learning (AutoML ), which aims to reduce or eliminate the need for expert-driv en manual\ndesign of machine learning models. Although our focus here i s on the design of prompts, prompts\nthemselves are discrete structures. Therefore, designing prompts is very similar to designing ma-\nchine learning models, such as discrete model architecture s. Perhaps one of the most related ﬁelds\nisneural architecture search (NAS ), where the most optimal neural networks are identiﬁed by\nexploring a space of possible neural networks [ Zoph and Le ,2016 ;Elsken et al. ,2019 ]. If we con-\nsider prompt optimization as a search process, then we can de scribe a general prompt optimization\nframework involving the following components:\n•Prompt Search Space . This deﬁnes all possible prompts that the algorithms can ex plore.\nFor example, one can edit some seed prompts to generate a set o f diverse candidate prompts.\n•Performance Estimation . Once an prompt is chosen, it needs to be evaluated. For examp le,\na straightforward way is to input it to an LLM and measure its p erformance on a validation\nset.\n•Search Strategy . The search process is generally the same as that used in many AI sys-\ntems. At each step, the system explores a set of promising pro mpts in the search space and\n\n--- Page 147 ---\n\n140 Prompting\nevaluates them. This process continues as more prompts are e xplored. The outcome of the\nsearch is the best-performing prompt observed until the sea rch stops.\nThis is a very general framework, and different prompt optim ization systems can vary in their\ndesign of each component. A widely-used approach is to use LL Ms as the basis to develop these\ncomponents. Initially, a few prompts are provided. Then, th e following process is iterated until\na stopping criterion is met: 1) the prompts are evaluated on a validation set; 2) a candidate pool\nis maintained by keeping only the most promising prompts; an d 3) new prompts are created by\nemploying LLMs to infer similar prompts from this candidate pool. One beneﬁt of this approach is\nthat it allows us to use off-the-shelf LLMs to perform the tas ks mentioned above without the need\nfor substantial system development. To achieve this, we can prompt or ﬁne-tune LLMs to adapt\nthem to these tasks. Here we consider Zhou et al. [2023c ]’s method for illustrating LLM-based\nprompt optimization. It involves the following steps.\n•Initialization . LetCrepresent the pool of the candidate prompts we intend to expl ore. The\nﬁrst step is to add initial prompts into C. We can do this in several ways. A simple method is\nto create such prompts by hand for a given task. However, in ma ny cases where humans have\nlimited knowledge about how to write effective prompts for t he task, developing prompts\nbecomes challenging. In these cases, it is desirable to use L LMs to generate prompts.\nFor example, we can directly instruct LLMs to produce prompt s, providing them with a\ndescription of the task.\nYou are given a task to complete using LLMs. Please write a pro mpt to\nguide the LLMs.\n{∗task-descripion ∗}\nThis method is straightforward, but it still requires a huma n-provided description of the",

For example, we can evaluate the output of the LLM given an input using a pre-deﬁned\nmetric, or alternatively, use the log-likelihood of the out put as a measure of the quality of\nthe prompt.\n•Pruning . IfCcontains a large number of prompts, it is reasonable to prune the unpromising\nprompts within it, thus reducing the computational burden i n subsequent steps. This is a\nstandard pruning problem. Given the evaluation score for ea ch prompt, a simple method is\nto keep only a certain percentage of the prompts and discard t he rest.\n•Expansion . Expansion is a key operation in search algorithms used to ex plore different\nstates in the search space. The expansion operation here can be deﬁned as a function\nC′= Expand( C,f) (3.10)\nwhereC′is the set of new prompts generated from Cusing the model f. If we consider f\nas an LLM, we can perform the expansion operation by instruct ingfto generate new and\nrelevant prompts based on C. Below is an example.\nBelow is a prompt for an LLM. Please provide some new prompts t o per-\nform the same task.\nInput: {∗prompt ∗}\nThen, we replace CwithC′. The steps of evaluation, pruning and expansion can be re-\npeated, and so we can gradually explore a wider range of promp ts.\nIn prompt optimization, the expansion step plays a key role, as it deﬁnes how we explore\nthe search space, and our goal is to ﬁnd optimal results with m inimal effort. One improvement\nto this step is to treat the problem as a paraphrasing task. A s imple method is to apply off-the-\nshelf paraphrasing systems, either based on LLMs or other mo dels, to transform input prompts\ninto semantically equivalent forms [ Jiang et al. ,2020 ]. Alternatively, we can deﬁne speciﬁc edit\noperations, such as insertions and modiﬁcations, for each t oken. A given prompt can be edited\ninto new prompts by applying these operations [ Prasad et al. ,2023 ]. Also, further evaluation and\npruning can be applied to ﬁlter out low-quality prompts. In a ddition to framing prompt generation\nas a paraphrasing problem, we can improve the quality of prom pts during expansion by learning\nfrom feedback [ Pryzant et al. ,2023 ]. This approach is somewhat related to the self-reﬁnement\nissue discussed in Section 3.2.3 . An LLM can be used to generate feedback on an input prompt,\nwhich is then revised based on this feedback. This feedback- and-revision cycle can be repeated\nmultiple times until the result converges or the desired out come is achieved.\nAnother approach to prompt optimization is to apply classic optimization techniques.

For\nexample, the problem can be framed as an evolutionary comput ation problem, where prompts\nare treated as candidates that evolve generation by generat ion as the optimization progresses\n[Guo et al. ,2024 ]. Since many powerful optimization algorithms have been de veloped in related\nﬁelds, they can be directly applied to this problem.\n\n--- Page 149 ---\n\n142 Prompting\nIn practice, we might be tempted to use existing LLM APIs to im plement the steps described\nabove. Such an approach, however, would be strongly depende nt on the inference and in-context\nlearning abilities of the LLMs. If these LLMs are not strong a nd lack adaptation to the tasks, they\nmay introduce errors into search, for example, generating i ncorrect prompts during expansion. In\nsuch cases, it is preferable to train models that are better s uited to the tasks. One approach in\nthis research direction appeals to reinforcement learning , which has been widely used in solving\ndiscrete decision making and optimization problems. For ex ample, Deng et al. [2022 ] developed\na prompt generator by integrating an FFN-based adaptor into an LLM. The prompt generator is\ntrained as a typical policy network, but only the parameters of the adaptor are updated while the\nremaining parameters of the model are kept unchanged. Durin g training, the reward is obtained by\ntesting the generated prompts using another LLM, similar to the evaluation method as discussed\nabove. Once the training is complete, the prompt generator i s then employed to generate new\nprompts.\nNote that, in our discussion here, prompts are simply seen as sequences of tokens, and the out-\nput of prompt optimization is such a sequence. However, in a s trict sense, prompts have complex\nstructures and include different ﬁelds such as user input, i nstruction, and demonstration. While\nour discussed approaches are mostly general, much work in pr ompt optimization has focused on\nlearning better instructions for prompting. Speciﬁcally, the goal is to generate instructions that\neffectively guide LLMs based on a given task. Of course, the c oncept of prompt optimization\ncan also be extended to learning other parts of prompts. For e xample, there has been substan-\ntial research interest in learning to select or generate dem onstrations in CoT [ Liu et al. ,2022 ;\nRubin et al. ,2022 ;Zhang et al. ,2023b ]. One of the differences between learning instructions\nand learning demonstrations is that generating high-quali ty demonstrations using LLMs is rela-\ntively easy and the focus of learning demonstrations is typi cally on how to sample appropriate\ndemonstrations from a pool of candidates. In contrast, the d ifﬁculty in learning instructions is\npartly because pre-trained LLMs are not suited to predict th e quality of instructions, and testing\nthese instructions on downstream tasks is computationally expensive. This makes the optimization\nmethods costly to apply, and exploring a wide variety of inst ructions poses signiﬁcant challenges.\n3.3.2 Soft Prompts\nAlthough developing natural language prompts, either manu ally or automatically, is a straight-\nforward and widely applied approach, it presents some probl ems. One problem is that natural\nlanguage prompts can be complex and lengthy, resulting in si gniﬁcant computational burdens\nwhen processed via LLMs. In many applications, users may nee d to perform a task repeatedly,\nand inputting the same long prompt into the LLMs a large numbe r of times is clearly inefﬁcient.\nAnother problem is that while prompts are typically represe nted as discrete token sequences (call\nthem hard prompts ) in regular LLM input, the LLMs encode them as low-dimension al real-\nvalued vectors.",

We can deﬁne hard prompts as explicit,\npredeﬁned text sequences that users input directly into LLM s to guide the responses.

Here the hard prompt i s the instruction we input to the LLM for\nperforming the task. The LLM encodes this instruction as usu al, and the intermediate representations corresponding to\nthe instruction can be viewed as some sort of soft prompt.\nhumans, soft prompts are encoded in a format that is more comp rehensible to the model rather\nthan to humans. To illustrate, consider a simple prompt\nTranslate the sentence into Chinese.\nConsider it done!\nHere, the instruction “Translate the sentence into Chinese ” can be seen as a hard prompt, denoted\nby the token sequence c1...c5. By feeding these tokens into an LLM, they are transformed in to a\nsequence of real-valued vectors h1...h5, each corresponding to a token. We can roughly think of\nh1...h5as a soft prompt, as illustrated in Figure 3.3.\nWhile the above example shows that soft prompts can be genera ted by transforming hard\nprompts, there is not necessarily a direct correspondence b etween them. In fact, we do not even\nneed to interpret soft prompts using meaningful text. They a re instead simply hidden states in\nLLMs and can be learned as standard parameters of the models t hrough continuous optimiza-\ntion. Such a treatment allows us to explore prompting method s beyond text. As another beneﬁt,\nsoft prompts provide dense, low-dimensional, and learnabl e representations for encoding how\nwe guide LLMs to generate speciﬁc outputs. The training and a pplication of these representa-\ntions require signiﬁcantly lower computational costs than those required for processing long hard\nprompts.

Consequentl y, the prompting information is\npartially captured in the model parameters, and the ﬁne-tun ed LLMs can perform the task with\nless prompting. Here we consider a simple form of prompt, whe re only an instruction (denoted by\nc) and an user input (denoted by z) are included. A prompt can be expressed using the following\ntuple\nx= (c,z) (3.11)\nGiven a set of prompt-response pairs D={(x,y)}, the objective of ﬁne-tuning is to minimize\nthe total loss incurred over this set. A popular method is to m inimize the negative log-likelihood\n(i.e., maximize the log-likelihood) with respect to the mod el parameters θ:\nˆθ= arg max\nθ∑\n(x,y)∈Dlog Pr θ(y|x)\n= arg max\nθ∑\n(x,y)∈Dlog Pr θ(y|c,z) (3.12)\nwhere Prθ(·|·)is the probability predicted by an LLM with the parameters θ9.\nIn general, the instruction in each ﬁne-tuning example shou ld follow the guideline of prompt\ndesign, for example, a good instruction should be as clear as possible and provide a detailed\ndescription of the task. However, the method described in th e above equation does not restrict the\ninstruction to any particular form. This ﬂexibility allows us to instruct LLMs in any way that we\nwant. Consider an example where we intend to instruct LLMs to translate an English sentence\ninto Chinese. Of course, as mentioned earlier in this chapte r, we can prompt LLMs using the\ninstruction\nTranslate the following sentence from English to Chinese.\nIf we want the instruction to be simpler, we may rephrase it in to a simpler form\nTranslate this into Chinese.\nEven, we can deﬁne the instruction as a single phrase\nTranslate!\nWith certain ﬁne-tuning effort, we can adapt LLMs to follow a ny of these instructions.

In scenar ios involving both complex and simpli-\nﬁed instructions for ﬁne-tuning, this problem is more sever e because the labeled data available for\nﬁne-tuning is usually limited, and accommodating a variety of instructions is costly.\nAn alternative way to adapt LLMs for simpliﬁed instructions is through knowledge distillation.\nAs an example, we consider the context distillation method [ Snell et al. ,2022 ]. The goal of this\nmethod is to learn a student model that can make use of simpliﬁ ed instructions from a well-trained\ninstruction-following teacher model. Figure 3.4shows an illustration of this approach. Building\nthe teacher model follows a standard ﬁne-tuning process: we ﬁrst collect a certain amount of\ndata that includes instructions, user inputs, and correct r esponses, and then we continue to train a\npre-trained model with this dataset. For building the stude nt model, we need to construct a new\ndataset D′where each sample is a tuple consisting of an instruction, a c orresponding simpliﬁed\ninstruction, and a user input, denoted by x′= (c,c′,z). Knowledge distillation is performed by\nminimizing a loss function deﬁned on the outputs of the teach er and student models\nˆθ= arg min\nθ∑\nx′∈D′Loss(Prt(·|·),Prs\nθ(·|·),x′) (3.13)\nwhere Prt(·|·)denotes the pre-trained teacher model, and Prs\nθ(·|·)denotes the student model with\nthe parameters θ. To keep the notation simple we will write Loss(Prt(·|·),Prs\nθ(·|·),x)asLoss\nfor short. A commonly-used loss is the sequence-level loss, which has the basic form:\nLoss =∑\nyPrt(y|c,z) log Prs\nθ(y|c′,z) (3.14)\nBut this function is computationally infeasible because it requires summing over an exponen-\ntially large number of outputs. A variant of this method is to train the student model using outputs\ngenerated by the teacher model. For each sample, we use the te acher model to produce an output\n\n--- Page 153 ---\n\n146 Prompting\nˆy= arg maxylog Prt(y|c,z). Then we consider ˆyas the target for learning, and the loss function\nis given by\nLoss = log Prs\nθ(ˆy|c′,z) (3.15)\nAlternatively, we can minimize the distances between the pr obability distributions outputted\nby the two models [ Askell et al. ,2021 ]. For example, the loss function can be deﬁned as the KL\ndivergence between the two output distributions\nLoss = KL(Pt||Ps\nθ) (3.16)\nwhere\nPt= Prt(·|c,z) (3.17)\nPs\nθ= Prs\nθ(·|c′,z) (3.18)\nAlthough we have restricted ourselves to knowledge distill ation for instructions, the approaches\ndiscussed here are general. By learning from the outputs of t he teacher model, the knowledge in\nprompting can be distilled into the parameters of the studen t model. Therefore, the distilled model\ncan be considered as encoding some sort of soft prompt.

Although\nﬁne-tuning is considered computationally cheaper than pre -training, it is still costly to apply in\npractice. This issue motivates the development of paramete r-efﬁcient ﬁne-tuning methods, which\naim to minimize the number of parameters that need to be updat ed.\nOne approach, known as preﬁx ﬁne-tuning , is to append a series of trainable vectors, or\npreﬁxes, at the beginning of the input of each Transformer la yer [ Li and Liang ,2021 ]. These\npreﬁxes can be thought of as soft prompts that serve as additi onal context to guide the behavior\nof the model under speciﬁc tasks. During ﬁne-tuning, we need only to learn the preﬁxes for\nembedding task-speciﬁc knowledge. Thus, this method is efﬁ cient because it only modiﬁes a\nsmall part of the model rather than adjusting the entire set o f model parameters.\nSpeciﬁcally, let the input of a layer at depth lbe denoted by Hl=hl\n0hl\n1...hl\nm. The output of\nthe layer can be expressed as\nHl+1= Layer( Hl) (3.19)\nIn preﬁx ﬁne-tuning, we extend the sequence hl\n0hl\n1...hl\nmby adding a few vectors at beginning,\nwhich we denote as pl\n0pl\n1...pl\nn. Hence Hlcan be written in the form\nHl=pl\n0pl\n1...pl\nn\ntrainablehl\n0hl\n1...hl\nm\nprevious layer output(3.20)\n\n--- Page 154 ---\n\n3.3 Learning to Prompt 147\nThe output of the layer is the last m+ 1representations.\nHl+1= Layer( Hl)[−m−1 :]\n=hl+1\n0hl+1\n1...hl+1\nm (3.21)\nwhere [−m−1 :]denotes the slicing operation that extracts the last m+1elements of a sequence.\nGiven Hl+1, the input of the next layer can be expressed in the same form o f Eq.

However,\nthis number is much smaller compared to the total number of pa rameters in the LLM, making the\nﬁne-tuning process highly efﬁcient.\nWhile preﬁx ﬁne-tuning is simple, it still requires modiﬁca tions to LLMs. Alternatively, sep-\narating soft prompts from the LLMs allows us to preserve the o riginal model architecture, making\nit more efﬁcient for deployment across different tasks with out the need to adjust the core model.\nOne such method is prompt tuning [ Lester et al. ,2021 ]. Like preﬁx ﬁne-tuning, prompt tuning\nincorporates trainable vectors so that LLMs can adapt to giv en tasks by adjusting these vectors.\nHowever, prompt tuning differs in that it modiﬁes only the em bedding layer.\nRecall that in LLMs each input token ziis represented by an embedding ei. These embeddings\nare generally learned through a token embedding model and ar e then used as the real inputs to the\nLLMs, replacing the symbolically represented tokens.

Another way to improve prompting is by combining soft and hard\nprompts, thereby taking advantage of both types [ Liu et al. ,2023b ].

In\nmany cases, however, the context is so long that applying an L LM is too costly or infeasible.\nModeling long input sequences can fall under the broad famil y of efﬁcient methods for long-\ncontext LLMs. Many techniques have been developed to addres s this issue.

Efﬁcient\nTransformer architectures and long-context LLMs have been intensively discussed in this book.\nFor more detailed discussions of these topics, interested r eaders can refer to Chapter 2.\nThere are also methods speciﬁcally designed to compress lon g context into soft prompts. Here\nwe consider Chevalier et al. [2023 ]’s method as an example. The basic idea is that we learn\nsoft prompts gradually by accumulating the ﬁxed-size conte xt representation over the context\nsequence. Given a long context, we ﬁrst divide it into a numbe r of segments z1,...,zK. We\nthen process these segments in sequence, each time generati ng a representation of the context we\nhave processed so far, denoted by σ<i+1.

The\nlack of interpretability can be a signiﬁcant barrier for use rs trying to understand how their inputs\ninﬂuence LLM outputs. Moreover, although soft prompts are e fﬁcient for ﬁne-tuning and de-\nployment, they are inﬂexible and do not allow for easy adjust ments without extensive ﬁne-tuning\nor modiﬁcation. This inﬂexibility can limit their utility i n dynamic environments where prompt\nchanges are frequently needed.\nOne alternative way to develop efﬁcient prompts is to simpli fy the text used for prompting.\nFor example, below is a prompt for answering questions on hea lthcare and ﬁnance.\nThe task involves developing a language model capable of und erstanding and\nresponding to user inquiries across various domains, with a particular emphasis\non healthcare and ﬁnance.

Our discussion\nhas focused mainly on two aspects:\n• How to design basic prompts to guide the predictions of LLMs and reﬁne these prompts for\nmore effective and efﬁcient problem-solving?\n• How to automate the design and representation of prompts?\nSolutions to these issues involve both general prompt desig ns and more advanced techniques, such\nas CoT and prompt learning, which have been explored extensi vely in recent research.\nIn NLP, prompting can be viewed as a technology that has evolv ed along with LLMs, and\nin a sense, it has opened the door to the practical applicatio n of these models in an impressive\nrange of problem domains. In fact, if we expand the concept of prompts to some extent, it can be\ntraced back to the early days of machine learning and NLP. For example, many NLP systems use\nhand-crafted features and templates to “prompt” speciﬁc ta sks. Imagine developing a feature to\nindicate whether a text is formal or informal. We can feed thi s feature into a machine translation\nsystem to condition the translation on the type of the input t ext.\nThe widespread use of the modern concept of prompts began wit h the rise of large pre-trained\nmodels in the ﬁeld of NLP. Initially, these models, such as BE RT, were adapted to speciﬁc down-\nstream tasks mainly through ﬁne-tuning. However, research ers soon discovered that by designing\nspeciﬁc \"prompts\" — adding certain words or sentences to the input — the models could be\ntriggered to respond to speciﬁc tasks without extensive ﬁne -tuning. This motivated the NLP com-\nmunity to develop and apply universal foundation models tha t can be prompted to address various\ntasks without changing the underlying architecture and the pre-training procedure.\nPrompting approaches were ﬁrst experimented with smaller m odels and later demonstrated\nimpressive capabilities with large models like GPT-3, whic h could generate high-quality text in\nresponse to simple prompts across various tasks. As prompti ng technology evolved, prompt en-\ngineering emerged as a critical area of research. As discuss ed in this chapter, it broadly involves\ndesigning effective prompts to maximize model performance , encompassing both hand-crafted\nand automatically generated prompts. More recent research has explored how to enhance the\neffectiveness of prompting through techniques like few-sh ot learning, zero-shot learning, and\nCoT reasoning, enabling LLMs to work effectively across a wi de range of scenarios. A gen-\neral discussion of prompting can be very broad, and we cannot cover all details in this chapter.\nFor more advanced techniques of prompting, the reader can re fer to recent surveys. Topics in-\nclude in-context learning [ Li,2023 ;Dong et al. ,2022 ], CoT [ Chu et al. ,2023 ;Yu et al. ,2023 ;\nZhang et al. ,2023a ], efﬁcient prompting [ Chang et al. ,2024 ], and general prompt engineering\n[Liu et al. ,2023c ;Chen et al. ,2023a ].\n\n--- Page 161 ---\n\n154 Prompting\nNote that although we would ideally like to develop general p rompting methods without ad-\njusting model architectures and parameters, the results of prompting generally depend heavily\non the quality and size of the given LLMs. For stronger models , such as commercialized online\nLLMs, simple prompts may be sufﬁcient to instruct these mode ls to perform tasks correctly. In\nthis case, prompt engineering is relatively easy, though we still need certain efforts to make LLMs\nwork properly.

In traditional NLP, the term alignment typically refers to the tasks that link corresponding\nelements in two sets, such as aligning words between a Chines e sentence and an English sentence.\nAs LLMs become increasingly important in NLP research, this term is more broadly used to refer\nto aligning model outputs with human expectations. The prob lem that alignment addresses is\nthat the output of a model may not align with the speciﬁc goals or contexts intended by users.\nFor example, pre-trained LLMs may not be able to follow user i nstructions because they were\nnot trained to do so. Another example is that LLMs may generat e harmful content or perpetuate\nbiases inherent in their training data. This poses new chall enges in ensuring that LLM outputs are\nnot only accurate and relevant, but also ethically sound and non-discriminatory.\nSimply pre-training LLMs can result in a variety of alignmen t problems. Our ultimate goal\nis to resolve or mitigate all these problems to ensure LLMs ar e both accurate and safe. There\nis an interesting issue here: since large language models ar e trained on vast amounts of data,\nwe have reason to believe that if we have sufﬁcient data cover ing a variety of tasks and aligned\nwith human preferences, pre-training could make LLMs accur ate and safe enough, perhaps even\neliminating the need for alignment. However, the reality is that it is nearly impossible to gather\ndata that encompasses all tasks or adequately represents hu man preferences. This makes it difﬁcult\nto achieve model alignment through pre-training alone, or a t least, at this stage, alignment remains\na very necessary and critical step in the development of LLMs .\nIn this chapter, we will focus on alignment methods for LLMs. We will begin by discussing the\ngeneral alignment tasks. Then we will consider two widely-u sed approaches, known as instruc-\ntion alignment andhuman preference alignment , respectively. The former resorts to supervised\nﬁne-tuning techniques and guides the LLMs to generate outpu ts that adhere closely to user instruc-\ntions. On the other hand, the latter typically relies on rein forcement learning techniques, where\nthe LLMs are trained based on feedback from humans. While the se methods are motivated by\ndifferent goals, they are commonly used together to develop well-aligned LLMs.\n4.1 An Overview of LLM Alignment\nAlignment can be achieved in several different ways. We need different methods for LLM align-\nment because this problem is itself complicated and multifa ceted, requiring a blend of technical\nconsiderations. Here we consider three widely-used approa ches to aligning LLMs.\nThe ﬁrst approach is to ﬁne-tune LLMs with labeled data. This approach is straightforward\nas it simply extends the pre-existing training of a pre-trai ned LLM to adapt it to speciﬁc tasks.\nAn example of this is supervised ﬁne-tuning (SFT), in which the LLM is further trained on a\ndataset comprising task-speciﬁc instructions paired with their expected outputs. The SFT dataset\nis generally much smaller compared to the original training set, but this data is highly specialized.\nThe result of SFT is that the LLM can learn to execute tasks bas ed on user instructions. For\nexample, by ﬁne-tuning the LLM with a set of question-answer pairs, the model can respond to\nspeciﬁc questions, even if not directly covered in the SFT da taset.",

    "content": " Here we consider three widely-used approa ches to aligning LLMs.\nThe ﬁrst approach is to ﬁne-tune LLMs with labeled data. This approach is straightforward\nas it simply extends the pre-existing training of a pre-trai ned LLM to adapt it to speciﬁc tasks.\nAn example of this is supervised ﬁne-tuning (SFT), in which the LLM is further trained on a\ndataset comprising task-speciﬁc instructions paired with their expected outputs. The SFT dataset\nis generally much smaller compared to the original training set, but this data is highly specialized.\nThe result of SFT is that the LLM can learn to execute tasks bas ed on user instructions. For\nexample, by ﬁne-tuning the LLM with a set of question-answer pairs, the model can respond to\nspeciﬁc questions, even if not directly covered in the SFT da taset. This method proves particularly\n155\n\n--- Page 163 ---\n\n156 Alignment\nPre-training PromptingInstruction\nAlignment\n(e.g., SFT)Human Preference\nAlignment\n(e.g., RLHF)Pre-training\nStageAlignment\nStage\nTraining & Fine-tuning Inference\nFig. 4.1: Schematic illustration of the pre-train-then-align metho d for developing LLMs. In the pre-training stage, we\ntrain an LLM on vast amounts of data using next token predicti on. Then, in the alignment stage, we align the LLM\nto user instructions, intents, and preferences. This inclu des instruction alignment, human preference alignment, an d\nprompting.\nuseful when it is relatively easy to describe the input-outp ut relationships and straightforward to\nannotate the data.\nThe second approach is to ﬁne-tune LLMs using reward models. One difﬁculty in alignment\nis that human values and expectations are complex and hard to describe. In many cases, even for\nhumans themselves, articulating what is ethically correct or culturally appropriate can be challeng-\ning. As a result, collecting or annotating ﬁne-tuning data i s not as straightforward as it is with SFT.\nMoreover, aligning LLMs is not just a task of ﬁtting data, or i n other words, the limited samples\nannotated by humans are often insufﬁcient to comprehensive ly describe these behaviors. What we\nreally need here is to teach the model how to determine which o utputs are more in line with human\npreferences, for example, we not only want the outputs to be t echnically accurate but also to align\nwith human expectations and values. One idea is to develop a r eward model analogous to a human\nexpert. This reward model would work by rewarding the LLM whe never it generates responses\nthat align more closely with human preferences, much like ho w a teacher provides feedback to a\nstudent. To obtain such a reward model, we can train a scoring function from human preference\ndata. The trained reward model is then used as a guide to adjus t and reﬁne the LLM. This frames\nthe LLM alignment task as a reinforcement learning task. The resulting methods, such as rein-\nforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF ), have been demonstrated to be particularly\nsuccessful in adapting LLMs to follow the subtleties of huma n behavior and social norms.\nThe third approach is to perform alignment during inference rather than during training or\nﬁne-tuning. From this perspective, prompting in LLMs can al so be seen as a form of alignment,\nbut it does not involve training or ﬁne-funing. So we can dyna mically adapt an LLM to various\ntasks at minimal cost. Another method to do alignment at infe rence time is to rescore the outputs\nof an LLM. For example, we could develop a scoring system to si mulate human feedback on the\noutputs of the LLM (like a reward model) and prioritize those that receive more positive feedback.\nThe three methods mentioned above are typically used in sequ ence once the pre-training is\ncomplete: we ﬁrst perform SFT, then RLHF, and then prompt the LLM in some way during\ninference. This roughly divides the development of LLMs int o two stages — the pre-training stage\nand the alignment stage. Figure 4.1shows an illustration of this. Since prompting techniques h ave\nbeen intensively discussed in the previous chapter, we will focus on ﬁne-tuning-based alignment\nmethods in the rest of this chapter.\n\n--- Page 164 ---\n\n4.2 Instruction Alignment 157\n4.2 Instruction Alignment\nOne feature of LLMs is that they can follow the",

In many applications, a prompt consists of a simple in struction and user input, and we want\nthe LLM to follow this instruction to perform the task correc tly. This ability of LLMs is also\ncalled the instruction-following ability. For example, be low is a prompt where we want the LLM\nto extract key points and provide a concise summary for a leng thy article.\nInstruction Summarize this text in three sentences.\nInput Daylight Savings Time (DST) - the process of moving clocks fo rward\nby one hour in the summer - was started in Germany in 1916 ...\nOutput\nThis task requires the LLM to understand the instruction “Su mmarize this text in three sentences”\nand perform the summarization accordingly. However, LLMs a re typically trained for next-token\nprediction rather than for generating outputs that follow i nstructions. Applying a pre-trained LLM\nto the above example would likely result in the model continu ing to write the input article instead\nof summarizing the main points. The goal of instruction alig nment (or instruction ﬁne-tuning ) is\nto tune the LLM to accurately respond to user instructions an d intentions. The rest of this section\nwill discuss some issues related to instruction alignment, including ﬁne-tuning LLMs to follow\ninstructions, generating or collecting instruction data, and generalizing instruction alignment.\n4.2.1 Supervised Fine-tuning\nOne straightforward approach to adapting LLMs to follow ins tructions is to ﬁne-tune these models\nusing annotated input-output pairs [ Ouyang et al. ,2022 ;Wei et al. ,2022a ]. Unlike standard lan-\nguage model training, here we do not wish to maximize the prob ability of generating a complete\nsequence, but rather maximizing the probability of generat ing the rest of the sequence given its\npreﬁx. This approach makes instruction ﬁne-tuning a bit dif ferent from pre-training. The SFT\ndata is a collection of such input-output pairs (denoted by S), where each output is the correct\nresponse for the corresponding input instruction. For exam ple, below is an SFT dataset\nx(instruction + user input) y(output)\nSummarize the following article. {∗summary ∗}\nArticle: In recent years, solar energy has seen\nunprecedented growth, becoming the fastest-growing ...\nExtract the main ﬁnancial ﬁgures from the following Revenue: $10 million,\nearnings report.

But\nthe reader should keep in mind that the ﬁne-tuning starts fro m the pre-trained parameters rather\nthan randomly initialized parameters.\nThe objective function log Pr θ(yi|x,y<i)is computed by summing the log-probabilities of\nthe tokens in y, conditional on the input xand all the previous tokens y<i:\nlog Pr θ(y|x) =n∑\ni=1log Pr θ(yi|x,y<i) (4.2)\nThis formulation is equivalent to minimizing the cross-ent ropy loss.\nNote that minimizing the conditional log-probability log Pr θ(y|x)is not a standard language\nmodel training problem. If we concatenate xandyas a single sequence, a more general form of\nlanguage modeling is based on the joint log-probability log Pr θ(x,y), that is, we minimize the\nloss over all tokens of the sequence seqx,y= [x,y]. We can write the probability of this sequence\nusing the chain rule\nlog Pr θ(seqx,y) = log Pr θ(x,y)\n= log Pr θ(x)\nset to 0+ log Pr θ(y|x)\nloss computation(4.3)\nThere are two terms on the right-hand side of the equation. We can simply set the ﬁrst term\nlog Pr θ(x)to 0, focusing solely on the second term log Pr θ(y|x)for loss computation. As a\nresult, the training can be implemented using standard LLMs . For the sequence seqx,y, we ﬁrst\nrun the forward pass as usual. Then, during the backward pass , we force the loss corresponding\ntoxto be zero.

Suppose we have\nKrounds of conversation, denoted by {x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xK,yK}. Here xkandykdenote the\nuser request and the response, respectively, for each round k.

For example,\n• SFT requires labeled data. This makes SFT quite different f rom pre-training, where raw text\nis used as training data and is readily available. As in other supervised machine learning\nproblems, data annotation and selection in SFT are not simpl e tasks. In general, we wish\nto develop SFT data that is both substantial in quantity and h igh in quality, and this data\nshould be highly relevant to the tasks the LLM will perform. O n the other hand, there is\na need to ﬁne-tune LLMs with less data to minimize computatio nal and data construction\ncosts. Often, the quality of LLMs is highly dependent on the d ata used in SFT. Thus, such\ndata must be carefully developed and examined. As we will see in later subsections, SFT\ncan be more efﬁcient and effective through more advanced tec hniques for data construction.\n• SFT is still computationally expensive for LLMs due to thei r big size. As a result, main-\ntaining and updating such models is resource-intensive. Fo r example, applying gradient up-\ndates to billions of parameters within an LLM requires signi ﬁcant computational power and\nmemory. This often requires high-performance computing en vironments, which are costly\nto operate. To address these challenges, various optimizat ion strategies, such as pruning,\nquantization, and the use of more efﬁcient training algorit hms, have been explored. In par-\nticular, there has been signiﬁcant interest in parameter-e fﬁcient ﬁne-tuning methods which\nare designed to maintain state-of-the-art performance wit hout the need for extensive compu-\ntational resources.

For further disc ussion on parameter-efﬁcient\nmethods, the reader can refer to related papers on this issue [Houlsby et al. ,2019 ;Hu et al. ,\n2022 ;Han et al. ,2024 ].\n• SFT can be regarded as a post-training step following pre-t raining. It is a separate training\nphase designed to preserve the advantages of the initial pre -training while incorporating new\nadjustments. This may seem paradoxical because updating a p re-trained LLM with further\ndata potentially causes the model to forget some of its prior knowledge. Imagine a scenario\nwhere we have a large amount of SFT data and extensively ﬁne-t une the LLM. In this\ncase, the LLM could overﬁt the data, which in turn may reduce g eneralization performance\nor cause catastrophic forgetting. A common strategy to miti gate this issue is to employ\nregularization and early stopping techniques. Another pra ctical approach is to use a smaller\nlearning rate to gently adjust the weights of the LLM. In addi tion, ﬁne-tuning with data from\ndiverse sources and problem domains can also be beneﬁcial. N evertheless, in practice, the\nSFT step is often carefully examined and requires substanti al engineering and experimental\nefforts to optimize.\n4.2.2 Fine-tuning Data Acquisition\nFine-tuning data is so important that much recent work in LLM has focused on developing various\ndatasets for instruction ﬁne-tuning. As with most work in ma chine learning, there are generally\ntwo approaches to data acquisition — manual data generation and automatic data generation.\n\n--- Page 169 ---\n\n162 Alignment\n4.2.2.1 Manually Generated Data\nOne straightforward method is to recruit human annotators t o create input-output pairs for the\ntasks of interest. Unlike data annotation in conventional N LP, such as text classiﬁcation, where\nannotators simply assign labels to collected texts accordi ng to guidelines, creating ﬁne-tuning data\nfor LLMs requires more steps and effort, making it thus more c hallenging. Suppose we want to\nobtain ﬁne-tuning data for the English-to-Chinese machine translation task. The ﬁrst step is to\nwrite a prompt template to describe the task and format the pr oblem clearly. For example,\nInstruction Translate the text from English to Chinese.\nUser Input {∗text∗}\nOutput {∗translation ∗}\nThen, we collect pairs of source and target texts (i.e., Chin ese texts and the corresponding\ntranslations), and replace the variables {∗text∗}and{∗translation ∗}to generate the ﬁne-tuning\nsamples. For example, given a pair of English and Chinese sen tences\nHow’s the weather today? →今天天气怎么样？\n{∗text∗} {∗ translation ∗}\nwe can generate a ﬁne-tuning sample using the prompt templat e, like this\nInstruction Translate the text from English to Chinese.\nUser Input How’s the weather today?\nOutput今天天气怎么样？\nThat is,\nx=Translate the text from English to Chinese. \\n How’s the weather today?\ny=今天天气怎么样？\nWe can use this (x,y)pair to ﬁne-tune the LLM, as described in the previous subsec tion.\nOne difﬁculty here is that there are many, many different way s to write prompt templates\nfor the same task, and different people may produce prompt te mplates with varying qualities\nand complexities. Sometimes, we may write prompt templates with overly complex or verbose\ninstructions. Sometimes, we may not even know exactly what t he target task is and how to de-\nscribe it. A widely-adopted strategy is to create prompt tem plates for existing NLP tasks, given\nthat there have been so many well-established NLP problems a nd benchmarks [ Bach et al. ,2022 ;\nWang et al. ,2022b ;Mishra et al. ,2022 ]. In this case, annotators can be given the original task\ndescription and many examples. Then, they can use their own w ays to express how to prompt the\nLLM to perform the tasks. Note that,",

Note that, while such a method can ea se the process of creating and\nwriting prompts, we still need annotation frameworks and cr owdsourcing systems to manage the\nwork and conduct quality control. For example, we generally need to design annotation guidelines\n\n--- Page 170 ---\n\n4.2 Instruction Alignment 163\nand a uniﬁed format for writing prompt templates, especiall y when many annotators are contribut-\ning to the same task. One advantage of inducing prompts from e xisting NLP tasks is that, once the\nprompt templates have been developed, it is easy to generate prompts using the annotated samples\nin the original tasks. For example, given a bilingual datase t for English-to-Chinese translation, we\ncan easily create a number of ﬁne-tuning examples by ﬁlling t he slots in the above template with\nthe sentence pairs in this dataset.\nAnother approach is to directly use the naturally existing d ata available on the internet. A\ncommon example is by collecting question-and-answer pairs from QA websites to ﬁne-tune LLMs\nfor open-domain QA tasks [ Joshi et al. ,2017 ]. Many benchmarks in QA are built in this way\nbecause there are so many types of questions that it is imposs ible to think of them all by a small\ngroup of people. Instead, using data from those websites can ensure that the LLM ﬁne-tuning data\nis at a good or acceptable level in terms of quantity and quali ty.\nIn addition to employing existing resources, another strai ghtforward way to develop a ﬁne-\ntuning dataset is to crowdsource the data. A simple approach is to allow users to input any ques-\ntion, after which responses are either manually given or aut omatically generated by an LLM and\nthen manually annotated and corrected. It is thus possible t o capture real user behavior and conse-\nquently gather inputs and outputs for a large number of “new” problems that traditional NLP tasks\ndo not cover.\nAn issue related to the construction of the ﬁne-tuning datas ets is that we usually want the\ndata to be as diverse as possible. Many studies have found tha t increasing the diversity of ﬁne-\ntuning data can improve the robustness and generalization a bility of LLMs. For this reason, there\nhas been considerable interest in involving more diverse pr ompts and tasks in LLM ﬁne-tunining\ndatasets. We will give further discussions on the generaliz ation of ﬁne-tuning in Section 4.2.4 .\n4.2.2.2 Automatically Generated Data\nOne limitation of manual data generation is that the quality and diversity largely depend on human\nexperience and creativity. Therefore, if we want LLMs to han dle a broad range of tasks, that\nis, to effectively execute any instruction, relying on huma n-annotated data for LLM ﬁne-tuning\nis often inefﬁcient. Moreover, the coverage of such data can be limited, and the data may even\ncontain biases introduced by the annotators themselves. An alternative approach is to generate data\nautomatically. For example, we can collect a number of quest ions through crowdsourcing, and\nemploy a well-tuned LLM to generate answers to the questions . These question-answer pairs are\nthen used as ﬁne-tuning samples as usual. This method, thoug h very simple, has been extensively\napplied to generate large-scale ﬁne-tuning data for LLMs.\nThe above way of producing synthetic ﬁne-tuning data is simi lar to those used in data aug-\nmentation for NLP.

More\nspeciﬁcally, we can specify the output (i.e., the class) wit h some prior, and prompt the LLM\nto generate user input given both the instruction and the out put.

For example, th is approach has been successfully\nused in parsing and machine translation [ Charniak ,1997 ;Sennrich et al. ,2016 ].\n4.2.3 Fine-tuning with Less Data\nWith the increasing prominence of instruction ﬁne-tuning, there has been a surge in demand for\nlarge-scale, high-quality ﬁne-tuning data. For example, t he FLAN ﬁne-tuning dataset, which\nis compiled from 1,836 tasks, contains 15 million samples [ Longpre et al. ,2023 ]. Fine-tuning\nLLMs with such large datasets is typically a computationall y expensive task, especially given\nthat updating the large number of parameters in LLMs is resou rce-intensive. One approach for\nmitigating this issue is to explore efﬁcient model training methods, for example, one can use\nparameter-efﬁcient methods to update only a small portion o f the model. However, many ﬁne-\ntuning datasets contain a large amount of synthetic data, wh ere errors and biases are still inevitable.\nAnother approach to efﬁcient ﬁne-tuning is to consider only the most relevant and impactful\nexamples for ﬁne-tuning. We can thus reduce the amount of dat a that needs to be processed while\nstill maintaining the quality of the model updates. There ar e several methods to achieve this. For\nexample, Zhou et al. [2023a ] built an instruction-following dataset containing only 1 ,000 sam-\nples by carefully crafting the prompts and collecting sampl es from a variety of NLP tasks. They\nshowed that the LLaMa 65B model ﬁne-tuned with this dataset c ould be competitive with or even\nbetter than models with much more ﬁne-tuning effort. This su ggests that LLMs can be adapted\nto respond to diverse tasks without necessarily needing ﬁne -tuning on all types of instruction-\nfollowing data. Chen et al. [2024a ] developed a system based on the GPT-3.5 model to assess\nthe quality of each instruction-following sample. Therefo re, they could select high-quality sam-\nples from existing datasets, showing better ﬁne-tuning per formance with fewer ﬁne-tuning sam-\nples. Researchers have also developed methods to either sel ect or ﬁlter out data using heuristics\n\n--- Page 174 ---\n\n4.2 Instruction Alignment 167\n[Zhao et al. ,2024 ;Ge et al. ,2024 ], or to prioritize data that more signiﬁcantly inﬂuences th e ﬁne-\ntuning process [ Xia et al. ,2024 ]. In fact, most of these methods can be seen as instances of la rger\nfamilies of data selection and ﬁltering methods. And it is of ten the case that using higher quality\n(but maybe less) data is beneﬁcial for training NLP models.\nThe discoveries in instruction ﬁne-tuning somewhat differ from traditional views in NLP: the\nability of models to handle complex problems can be activate d with a small amount of annotated\ndata, rather than requiring massive amounts of supervised d ata for extensive training. One pos-\nsible explanation is that the ability of generating correct responses given instructions has been\nlearned during pre-training, but such instruction-respon se mappings are not with high probabil-\nities during inference. Fine-tuning can slightly adjust th e models to get them to follow instruc-\ntions, requiring signiﬁcantly less training effort than pr e-training.",

Fine-tuning can slightly adjust th e models to get them to follow instruc-\ntions, requiring signiﬁcantly less training effort than pr e-training. This is closely related to what\nis known as the superﬁcial alignment hypothesis , which suggests that learning primarily occurs\nduring pre-training, and the subsequent ﬁne-tuning or alig nment phase does not signiﬁcantly con-\ntribute to the underlying knowledge base of an LLM [ Zhou et al. ,2023a ]. Since the core abilities\nand knowledge of the model are already established from pre- training, effective ﬁne-tuning for\nalignment with user needs can be achieved with relatively sm all training ﬁne-tuning effort. This\nimplies the possibility of ﬁne-tuning LLMs with very little data. In another direction, it may not\nbe necessary to restrict ﬁne-tuning to paired instruction- response data. For example, Hewitt et al.\n[2024 ] found that instruction-following can be implicitly achie ved by ﬁne-tuning LLMs only on\nresponses, without corresponding instructions.\nA concept related to the discussion here is sample efﬁciency . A machine learning method is\ncalled sample efﬁcient if it can learn effectively from a small number of training ex amples. In this\nsense, instruction ﬁne-tuning is sample efﬁcient compared with pre-training. From the perspective\nof machine learning, sample-efﬁcient methods can be seen as efﬁcient ways to sample the space\nof data, and are advantageous as they make optimal use of scar ce data. Therefore, sampling-based\nlearning techniques, such as many reinforcement learning a lgorithms, can beneﬁt from these sam-\nple efﬁcient approaches. For example, in human preference a lignment, we can either efﬁciently\nsample preference data via reward models [ Liu et al. ,2024b ] or improve sampling efﬁciency in\npolicy learning [ Wang et al. ,2024 ].\n4.2.4 Instruction Generalization\nIn many machine learning and NLP problems, training a model t o generalize is a fundamental\ngoal. For example, in text classiﬁcation, we expect our mode l to correctly classify new texts that\nwere not seen during training. However, generalization pos es additional challenges in instruction\nﬁne-tuning. We expect instruction-ﬁne-tuned LLMs to not on ly generate appropriate responses for\ndifferent inputs within a task but also to accurately perfor m various tasks as described by different\ninstructions. To illustrate this issue, consider an LLM Pr(y|c,z), where cis an instruction, z\nis a user input, and yis the corresponding model output (i.e., the response). Sup pose that the\nperformance of this model is evaluated in terms of a metric, w ritten as Performance(Pr( y|c,z))\norP(c,z,y)for short. Informally, when we say this model can generalize within a given task\n(indicated by the instruction c∗), we mean that there may be a value ǫsuch that the average\nperformance on new inputs is above this value:\n1\n|Z|∑\nz′∈ZP(c∗,z′,y′)>ǫ (4.8)\n\n--- Page 175 ---\n\n168 Alignment\nwhere Zis the set of new inputs, and z′andy′are an input in this set and the corresponding\noutput, respectively.\nLikewise, we can say that this model can generalize across ta sks if the average performance\nover all instruction-input pairs is above some ǫ:\n1\n|D|∑\n(c′,z′)∈DP(c′,z′,y′)>ǫ (4.9)\nwhere Dis the set of new instruction-input pairs.\nHere, we need to deal with variations in two",

This\nmakes the generalization problem very complex, because, in tuitively, a model needs to learn from\na vast number of tasks and different input-output pairs asso ciated with each task to achieve good\ngeneralization. As we have discussed several times in this b ook, achieving such generalization\nincurs much lower cost than pre-training. In general, ﬁne-t uning LLMs with instruction-response\ndata to some extent can lead to models yielding instruction f ollowing on new tasks. Nevertheless,\nit is typically believed that certain efforts are still need ed to adapt LLMs to make them understand\nand execute instructions broadly.\nOne way to generalize instruction ﬁne-tuning is to increase the diversity of the ﬁne-tuning\ndata. In earlier studies on instruction ﬁne-tuning, resear chers developed many datasets, covering a\nwide variety of NLP tasks and different instructions for eac h task [ Wang et al. ,2022b ;Sanh et al. ,\n2022 ;Longpre et al. ,2023 ]. By transforming these tasks into a uniﬁed format, one can ﬁ ne-\ntune an LLM with a sufﬁciently large number of samples, for ex ample, there have been several\ninstruction ﬁne-tuning datasets that involve over 100 NLP t asks and 1M samples. However, these\nearly datasets mostly focus on existing academic problems, but not those that users want to deal\nwith in real-world applications. Much recent work has shift ed focus to addressing new and more\npractical problems. For example, there has been considerab le interest in constructing datasets\nthat contain large and complicated demonstrations and resp onses from SOTA models to real user\nqueries [ Wang et al. ,2023c ;Teknium ,2023 ].\nPerhaps the use of large and diverse ﬁne-tuning datasets has its origins in attempts to scale\nLLMs in different dimensions. Indeed, scaling laws have bee n used broadly to motivate the de-\nvelopment of a wide range of different instruction-ﬁne-tun ed LLMs. And it is reasonable to scale\ninstruction ﬁne-tuning to make an LLM follow broad instruct ions. From the perspective of LLM\nalignment, however, scaling instruction ﬁne-tuning might not be efﬁcient to achieve generaliza-\ntion.\nOne problem is that instruction ﬁne-tuning relies on superv ised learning that learns to gener-\nalize and perform tasks based on instruction-response mapp ings. However, such an approach does\nnot capture subtle or complex human preferences (e.g., tone , style, or subjective quality) because\nthese are hard to encode as explicit instruction-response d ata. Moreover, the generalization per-\nformance is bounded by the diversity and quality of the instr uction-response dataset. Given these\nlimitations, we would instead like to employ preference mod els as an additional ﬁne-tuning step\nfollowing instruction ﬁne-tuning, so the LLMs can generali ze further (see Section 4.3).\nAnother view is that some instruction-response mappings ma y already be learned during pre-\ntraining, and so the pre-trained LLMs have encoded such mapp ings. However, since we often do\nnot know exactly what data is used in the pre-training, it is h ard to judge whether we need to learn\nsuch mappings in the ﬁne-tuning. A related question is wheth er out-of-distribution generalization\n\n--- Page 176 ---\n\n4.2 Instruction Alignment 169\nis primarily achieved during pre-training or ﬁne-tuning.

W hile directly answering this question is\nbeyond the scope of this chapter, it has been shown that pre-t raining on large and diverse datasets\nis effective in improving out-of-distribution performanc e [Hendrycks et al. ,2020 ;Radford et al. ,\n2021 ;Gunasekar et al. ,2023 ]. This raises an interesting problem: if an LLM has been well pre-\ntrained at scale, ﬁne-tuning may not be as essential for out- of-distribution generalization, since the\nmodel may have already encountered sufﬁcient distribution al variation. This prompts researchers\nto ﬁne-tune LLMs with modest effort or to explore new methods to achieve instruction-following.\nAs discussed in the previous sub-section, for example, inst ruction following can be yielded by\nﬁne-tuning on a small number of carefully selected instruct ion-response pairs [ Zhou et al. ,2023a ],\nor even by using methods that are not explicitly designed to d o so [ Kung and Peng ,2023 ].\nThe above discussion provides two different strategies: on e requires scaling up ﬁne-tuning\ndatasets for larger diversity, the other requires small but necessary ﬁne-tuning datasets for efﬁcient\nLLM adaptation. However, in practice, involving diverse in structions often helps. In many cases,\nwe need to adapt our LLM for speciﬁc purposes. But the LLM, whi ch has possibly encoded broad\ninstruction-following mappings during pre-training, mig ht tend to behave as a general-purpose\ninstruction executor even with modest ﬁne-tuning. An inter esting phenomenon is that when ﬁne-\ntuning on math data, the resulting LLM might not specialize i n math outputs. Instead, this model\nmight respond normally to general instructions, for exampl e, it could generate poetry if instructed\nto do so [ Hewitt ,2024 ]. This is not a bad thing, but it shows that LLMs may not easily change their\nnature of following general instructions. In this case, add itional adaptations with more diverse\ndata may help adjust the way the LLM follows instructions, pa rticularly for those tasks we aim to\naddress.\n4.2.5 Using Weak Models to Improve Strong Models\nSo far we have explored a variety of instruction ﬁne-tuning m ethods based on labeled data. One\nof the limitations of many such methods is that they require t he data to be annotated by humans or\ngenerated by strong LLMs, which can provide accurate superv ision signals in ﬁne-tuning. How-\never, in many cases, the LLM we have in hand is already strong ( or at least is advantageous in\nspeciﬁc aspects of problem solving), and thus it is not easy t o ﬁnd a superior model for supervi-\nsion. Even for human experts, when the problem becomes compl ex, providing correct and detailed\nanswers might be difﬁcult, or sometimes infeasible. For exa mple, when faced with an extremely\nlong document, the experts would ﬁnd it challenging to ident ify any inconsistencies, subtle biases,\nor missing key points without conducting an exhaustive and t ime-consuming review.\nOne may ask at this point: can we use weak LLMs to supervise str ong LLMs? This seems\nto be a signiﬁcant challenge, but it may reﬂect a future scena rio where we need to supervise AI\nsystems that are smarter than humans or any other AI systems [ Burns et al. ,2023b ]. The problem\nof using smaller, less complex models to improve the trainin g of larger, more complex models\nis also called the weak-to-strong generalization problem.

While there have not been mature\napproaches to weak-to-strong generalization, using small er models to assist stronger models has\nindeed proven useful in several areas of LLMs.\nFor instruction ﬁne-tuning, one of the simplest ways of appl ying weak LLMs is to use these\nmodels to generate synthetic ﬁne-tuning data. Suppose we ha ve a collection of inputs X, where\neach input includes an instruction and a user input if necess ary. For each x∈X, we use a weak\nLLM Prw(·)to generate a prediction ˆy= arg maxyPrw(y|x). Then, the strong LLM Prs\nθ(·)can\n\n--- Page 177 ---\n\n170 Alignment\nbe trained on these generated predictions (see Eq. ( 4.1)):\n˜θ= arg max\nθ∑\nx∈Xlog Prs\nθ(ˆy|x) (4.10)\nwhereθis the model parameters.\nThe above form transforms the ﬁne-tuning problem into a know ledge distillation problem, in\nother words, we distill knowledge from the weak model to the s trong model. Consequently, we\ncan employ various knowledge distillation methods to achie ve this goal. However, explaining\nweak-to-strong ﬁne-tuning from the perspective of knowled ge distillation is not straightforward.\nA major concern is that the strong model may merely imitate or overﬁt the errors of the weak\nmodel and fail to generalize. For example, the ﬁne-tuned str ong model still cannot solve difﬁcult\nproblems that the weak model cannot accurately predict. For tunately, preliminary experiments in\nthis line of research have shown positive and promising resu lts. For example, Burns et al. [2023a ]\nfound that ﬁne-tuning the strong pre-trained GPT-4 model wi th GPT-2-level supervision could\nimprove generalization across several NLP tasks. To measur e how the weak model improves the\ngeneralization of the strong model, we deﬁne the following t erms:\n•Weak Performance (Pweak). This is the test-set performance of the weak model, which\ncan be regarded as the baseline performance.\n•Weak-to-strong Performance (Pweak →strong ). This is the test-set performance of the strong\nmodel that is ﬁne-tuned with the weak model.\n•Strong Ceiling Performance (Pceiling ). This is the test-set performance of the strong model\nthat is ﬁne-tuned with ground truth data. For example, we ﬁne -tune the strong model with\nhuman-annotated predictions and take the resulting model a s a ceiling.\nThen, the performance gap recovered (PGR ) can be deﬁned as\nPGR = max{\n0,Pweak →strong −Pweak\nPceiling −Pweak}\n(4.11)\nThis metric measures how much of the performance gap between the ceiling model and the\nweak model can be recovered by the weak-to-strong model. A PG R of 1 indicates that the weak-\nto-strong ﬁne-tuning can completely closes the performanc e gap, whereas a PGR of 0 indicates\nno improvement. In Burns et al. [2023a ]’s work, it is shown that PGR can be around 0.8on 22\nNLP classiﬁcation tasks. It should be noted that, while the p otential of weak-to-strong ﬁne-tuning\nis promising, achieving substantial weak-to-strong gener alization remains a challenging goal that\nneeds further investigation [ Aschenbrenner ,2024 ].\nFine-tuning LLMs with weak supervision is just one choice fo r using small models to improve\nlarge models.

This approach signiﬁcantly\nreduces computational costs and latency, as the small model can effectively handle many\ninputs without access to the large model.\n4.3 Human Preference Alignment: RLHF\nSo far in this chapter, we have focused on ﬁne-tuning LLMs usi ng input-output paired labeled data.\nThis approach allows us to adapt LLMs for instruction-follo wing via supervised learning. In many\napplications, however, LLMs are required not only to follow instructions but also to act in ways\nthat are more aligned with human values and preferences. Con sider a scenario where a user asks an\nLLM how to hack into a computer system. If the LLM is not approp riately aligned, it may respond\nby providing details on how to perform this illegal activity . Instead, a more desirable response\nmight be to advise the user against engaging in illegal activ ities and offer a general overview of\nthe consequences of such actions. The difﬁculty in achievin g this is that the ethical nuances and\ncontextual considerations required for an LLM to respond ap propriately in such scenarios are not\nalways straightforward to encode into a ﬁne-tuning dataset . What’s even more challenging is that,\noften, humans themselves cannot precisely express their ow n preferences.\nIn this section, we discuss an alternative LLM ﬁne-tuning me thod, called reinforcement learn-\ning from human feedback or RLHF for short [ Christiano et al. ,2017 ;Stiennon et al. ,2020 ]. The\nbasic idea behind RLHF is that LLMs can learn from comparison s of model outputs using reward\n\n--- Page 180 ---\n\n4.3 Human Preference Alignment: RLHF 173\nLLM\nxy\nPredicted Token Distributions\n(ntoken distributions)Gold-standard Predictions\n(none-hot distributions)Objective (MLE):\nmax Pr( y|x)\nwhere\nx: input\ny: gold-standard output\n(a) Supervised ﬁne-tuning (maximizing the prediction prob ability given the input)\nLLM\nxy1y2Generate multiple\noutputs via sampling\nPrediction y2Prediction y1Objective (RL Loss Minimization):\nminL(x,{y1,y2},r)Reward Model Human preference datatrain\nwhere\nL(·): loss function\nr(·): reward model\n(b) Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback\nFig. 4.6: Supervised ﬁne-tuning vs. reinforcement learning from hum an feedback.

Once trained, the reward model\nprovides feedback by assigning scores to new outputs that th e LLM generates in response to the\ninputs. The LLM uses these scores to update its parameters th rough reinforcement learning algo-\nrithms. In the rest of this section, we will ﬁrst introduce th e basic knowledge of reinforcement\nlearning to facilitate the discussion, and then discuss met hods for training reward models and\naligning LLMs with these models.\n4.3.1 Basics of Reinforcement Learning\nWe begin by looking at some basic concepts of reinforcement l earning. Note that the notation used\nhere slightly differs from that used in the previous section s and chapters because we want to make\nour description more consistent with those in the reinforce ment learning literature. Nevertheless,\nwe will show how this notation corresponds to the language mo deling notation. The reader who\nis already familiar with reinforcement learning technique s may skip or skim this subsection.\nA general reinforcement learning framework describes how a n agent interacts with a dynamic\nenvironment. This interaction is modeled as a sequence of ac tions taken by the agent in response\nto the state of the environment. At each time step, the agent o bserves the current state, chooses an\naction based on its policy, performs the action, and then rec eives feedback from the environment\nin the form of a reward and a new state. This sequence of observ e-act-receive feedback is repeated\n\n--- Page 181 ---\n\n174 Alignment\nuntil the agent achieves its goal.\nA reinforcement learning system involves several componen ts\n•Agent . This is the learner or decision-maker in reinforcement lea rning. In the context of\nLLMs, it can be seen as the LLM itself.\n•Environment . This includes everything external to the agent with which t he agent interacts.\nBut the environment in LLMs is less about a physical or virtua l space and more about the\nframework within which the agent (e.g., an LLM) receives fee dback and learns.\n•State (s). A state represents the current situation of the environme nt. Given a sequence of\ntokens for language modeling, a state at a time step can be vie wed as the tokens we observed\nso far, that is, the context tokens we take to predict the next token. For example, we can\ndeﬁne (x,y<t)as the state when predicting the next token at the time step t.\n•Action (a). Actions represent possible decisions the agent can make. We can see them as\npossible predicted tokens in the vocabulary.\n•Reward (R). The reward is the feedback from the environment that evalu ates the success\nof an action. For example, r(s,a,s′)denotes the reward the agent receives for taking the\nactionaat the statesand moving to the next state s′. If the state-action sequence is given,\nwe can denote the reward at the time step tasrt=r(st,at,st+1). Also note that if the\ndecision-making process is deterministic, we can omit st+1because it is can be determined\nbystandat. In such cases, we can use r(st,at)as shorthand for r(st,at,st+1).\n•Policy (π). For an LLM, a policy is deﬁned as the probability distribut ion over the tokens\nthat the LLM predicts, given the preceding context tokens. F ormally, this can be expressed\nas\nπ(a|s) = Pr(yt|x,y<t) (4.14)\nwhereacorresponds to the token y, andscorresponds to the context (x,y<t). Figure 4.7",

If w e take Eq. ( 4.18) and use gradient\ndescent to optimize the policy, this approach would constit utes a form of policy gradient methods\n[Williams ,1992 ].\nNote that in many NLP problems, such as machine translation, rewards are typically sparse.\nFor instance, a reward is only received at the end of a complet e sentence. This means that rt= 0\nfor allt < T , andrtis non-zero only when t=T. Ideally, one might prefer feedback to\nbe immediate and frequent (dense), and thus the training of t he policy can be easier and more\nefﬁcient. While several methods have been proposed to addre ss sparse rewards, such as reward\nshaping, we will continue in our discussion to assume a spars e reward setup, where the reward is\navailable only upon completing the prediction.\nThe model described in Eqs. ( 4.17-4.19) establishes a basic form of reinforcement learning,\nand many variants and improvements of this model have been de veloped.

The m ain component of this model is still an LLM.\nWe use the Transformer decoder as the sequence representati on model. We extract the representation of the last position\nof the decoder as the representation of the entire sequence [x,y]. We then map this representation to a scalar through a\nlinear transformation, which serves as the reward score for [x,y].\nandyare assumed to complete texts. This means that the reward mod el evaluates the relationship\nbetween inputs and outputs that provide full semantic conte nt. For example, when applying the\nreward model, it assigns a value of 0 (or another predetermin ed value) at each position tin the\noutput sequence y=y1...yn. Only at the ﬁnal position, when t=n, does the reward model\ngenerate the actual reward score. To keep the notation unclu ttered, we will use r(x,y)to denote\nthe reward model Reward( x,y)from here on.\nThere are many ways to implement the reward model. One simple approach is to build the\nreward model based on a pre-trained LLM. More speciﬁcally, w e can concatenate xandyto form\na single token sequence seqx,y= [x,y]. We run a pre-trained LLM on this sequence, as usual,\nand at each position, we obtain a representation from the top -most Transformer layer. Then, we\ntake the representation at the last position (denoted by hlast) and map it to a scalar via linear\ntransformation:\nr(x,y) = hlastWr (4.34)\nwhere hlastis ad-dimensional vector, and Wris ad×1linear mapping matrix. This architecture\nof the reward model is illustrated in Figure 4.8.\nTo train the reward model, the ﬁrst step is to collect human fe edback on a set of generated\noutputs. Given an input x, we use the LLM to produce multiple candidate outputs {y1,...,yN}.\nHuman feedback can be obtained in several ways:\n•Pairwise Comparison (Pairwise Ranking ). Given two different outputs, human experts\nselect which one is better.\n•Rating . Human experts provide a score or rating to each output. This score is often a\ncontinuous or discrete numerical value, such as a score on a s cale (e.g., 1-5 stars, or 1-10\npoints). In some cases, the rating might be binary, indicati ng a “yes/no” or “positive/nega-\ntive” preference.\n\n--- Page 188 ---\n\n4.3 Human Preference Alignment: RLHF 181\n•Listwise Ranking . Human experts are asked to rank or order the given set of poss ible\noutputs.\nHere we consider pairwise comparison feedback as it is one of the simplest and most com-\nmon forms of human feedback used in RLHF. In this setting, eac h time, two outputs (ya,yb)are\nrandonly drawn from the candidate pool {y1,...,yN}. Human experts are then presented with\nthese pairs and asked to decide which output they prefer base d on speciﬁc criteria, such as clarity,\nrelevance, and accuracy. The human feedback can be encoded a s a binary label, ya≻ybfor a\npreference for ya, and yb≻yafor a preference for yb.\nOne simple and widely used model for describing such pairwis e comparisons is the Bradley-\nTerry model [Bradley and Terry ,1952 ].

In practice,\nhowever, we often only sample a relatively small number of se quences using a policy in policy learning. As a result,\nthe sampling method itself matters. Eq. ( 4.47) offers an interesting manner to separate the sampling and r eward\ncomputation processes: we ﬁrst use a baseline policy (with θref) to sample a number of sequences, and then use the\ntarget policy (with θ) to compute the expected reward. In this way, we separate the policy used for collecting the data,\nand the policy used for computing the gradient. This approac h avoids the need to directly sample from the policy we are\nevaluating, which can be beneﬁcial in cases where generatin g sequences from the target policy is expensive or difﬁcult.\nIn reinforcement learning, Eτ∼πθref[\nPrθ(τ)\nPrθref(τ)R(τ)]\nis often called a surrogate objective .\nEq.

To mitigate\nthis issue, techniques such as clipping are often employed t o bound the importance weights and\nprevent large updates.

In reinforcement learning, a large update to the policy ca n lead to instability, where the\nagent may start performing worse after an update. A reasonab le idea is to optimize the model in\nthe trust region, which refers to a region around the current parameter estimate where the model\nis well-behaved.

In reinforcement learning, a large update to the policy ca n lead to instability, where the\nagent may start performing worse after an update. A reasonab le idea is to optimize the model in\nthe trust region, which refers to a region around the current parameter estimate where the model\nis well-behaved. One approach to incorporating trust regio ns is to impose a constraint on the size\nof the policy update, ensuring that the current policy does n ot deviate too signiﬁcantly from the\nreference policy. This can be achieved by adding a penalty ba sed on some form of divergence\nbetween the current and reference policies to the objective function. A simple form of such a\npenalty is given by the difference in the log-probability of the sequence τunder the current policy\nversus the reference policy:\nPanalty = log πθ(τ)−logπθref(τ) (4.51)\nIn practice, this penalty can be approximated by considerin g only the policy probabilities and\nignoring the dynamics. This gives\nPenalty =T∑\nt=1logπθ(at|st)−T∑\nt=1logπθref(at|st) (4.52)\nBy including this penalty in the optimization objective, we encourage the current policy to remain\nclose to the reference policy, limiting very large updates t hat could destabilize learning.\nWe can incorporate this penalty into the clipped surrogate o bjective function, and obtain\nUppo-clip(τ;θ) =Uclip(τ;θ)−βPenalty (4.53)\nwhereβis the weight of the penalty. This training method is called proximal policy optimization\n(PPO ), which is one of the most popular reinforcement learning me thods used in LLMs and many\nother ﬁelds [ Schulman et al. ,2017 ].\nNow we can write the objective of training LLMs in the form of P PO.\nthe parameter update at the point θ=θrefon the optimization surface.\n\n--- Page 192 ---\n\n4.3 Human Preference Alignment: RLHF 185\nU(x,y;θ) =Uppo-clip(x,y;θ)−βPenalty (4.54)\nwhere\nUppo-clip(x,y;θ) =T∑\nt=1Clip(πθ(yt|x,y<t)\nπθref(yt|x,y<t))\nA(x,y<t,yt) (4.55)\nPenalty = log Pr θ(y|x)−log Pr θref(y|x)\n=T∑\nt=1log Pr θ(yt|x,y<t)−T∑\nt=1log Pr θref(yt|x,y<t) (4.56)\nAlthough the notation here appears a bit tedious, the idea of PPO is simple: we develop an\nobjective by combining the clipped likelihood ratio of the t arget and reference policies with an\nadvantage function, and then impose a penalty that ensures p olicy updates are not too large.

In this section, we will discuss some reﬁn ements of RLHF and alternative\nmethods to achieve human preference alignment.\n4.4.1 Better Reward Modeling\nIn Section 4.3.2 , we highlighted the task of learning from human preferences as well as the use\nof pairwise ranking loss for training reward models. Here we consider more methods for reward\nmodeling. Our discussion will be relatively general, and si nce the reward model is widely used in\nmany reinforcement learning problems, it will be easy for us to apply the methods discussed here\nto RLHF and related applications.\n4.4.1.1 Supervision Signals\nThe training of reward models can broadly be seen as a ranking problem, where the model learns\nto assign scores to outputs so that their order reﬂects the pr eferences indicated by humans. There\nare several methods to train a reward model from the perspect ive of ranking.\nOne approach is to extend pairwise ranking to listwise ranki ng. For each sample in a dataset,\nwe can use the LLM to generate multiple outputs, and ask human experts to order these outputs.\nFor example, given a set of four outputs {y1,y2,y3,y4}, one possible order of them can be\ny2≻y3≻y1≻y4. A very simple method to model the ordering of the list is to ac cumulate the\npairwise comparison loss. For example, we can deﬁne the list wise loss by accumulating the loss\nover all pairs of outputs:\nLlist=−E(x,Y)∼D r[1\nN(N−1)∑\nya∈Y,yb∈Y\nya̸=yblog Pr( ya≻yb|x)]\n(4.57)\nwhereYis a list of outputs, and Nis the number of outputs in the list. Pr(ya≻yb|x)can be\ndeﬁned using the Bradley-Terry model, that is, Pr(ya≻yb|x) = Sigmoid( r(x,ya)−r(x,yb)).\nHere we omit the φsuperscript on the Pr(·)to keep the notation uncluttered.\nAn extension to the Bradley-Terry model for listwise rankin g could involve a ranking mecha-\nnism that takes into account the entire list of outputs rathe r than just pairwise comparisons. One\nsuch model is the Plackett-Luce model , which generalizes the Bradley-Terry model to handle\nmultiple items in a ranking [ Plackett ,1975 ]. In the Plackett-Luce model, for each item in a list,\nwe deﬁne a “worth” for this item that reﬂects its relative str ength of being chosen over other items.\nFor the reward modeling problem here, the worth of yin the listYcan be deﬁned as\nα(y) = exp( r(x,y)) (4.58)\n\n--- Page 195 ---\n\n188 Alignment\nThen the probability of selecting yfromYis given by\nPr(yis selected |x,Y) =α(y)∑\ny′∈Yα(y′)\n=exp(r(x,y))∑\ny′∈Yexp(r(x,y′))(4.59)\nSuppose ˚",

All these methods can be cate-\ngorized into a large family of learning-to-rank approaches , and most of them are applicable to the\nproblem of modeling human preferences. However, discussin g these methods is beyond the scope\nof this chapter. Interested readers can refer to books on thi s topic for more details [ Liu,2009 ;Li,\n2011 ].\nIn addition to pairwise and listwise ranking, using pointwi se methods to train reward models\noffers an alternative way to capture human preferences. Unl ike methods that focus on the relative\nrankings between different outputs, pointwise methods tre at each output independently. For ex-\nample, human experts might assign a score to an individual ou tput, such as a rating on a ﬁve-point\nscale. The objective is to adjust the reward model so that its outputs align with these scores. A\nsimple way to achieve pointwise training is through regress ion techniques where the reward of\neach output is treated as a target variable. Let ϕ(x,y)be the score assigned to ygiven xby\nhumans. Pointwise reward models can be trained by minimizin g a loss function, often based on\nmean squared error or other regression losses, between the p redicted reward r(x,y)and the actual\nhuman feedback ϕ(x,y). For example, the loss function could be\nLpoint =−E[ϕ(x,y)−r(x,y)]2(4.62)\nWhile pointwise methods are conceptually simpler and can di rectly guide the reward model to\n\n--- Page 196 ---\n\n4.4 Improved Human Preference Alignment 189\npredict scores, they might not always be the best choice in RL HF.

Moreover,\nﬁtting to speciﬁc scored outputs might discourage generali zation, particularly given that training\ndata is often very limited in RLHF. In contrast, methods that consider relative preferences can\npromote the learning of more generalized patterns of succes s and failure. Nevertheless, there are\nscenarios where pointwise methods might still be suitable. For example, in tasks where training\ndata is abundant and the costs of obtaining accurate, consis tent annotations are low, pointwise\nmethods can prove effective.\nIn fact, to make the supervision signal for training the rewa rd model more robust, we can also\nintroduce additional regularization terms into training. For example, if we consider the ﬁrst term\nUppo-clip(x,y;θ)in Eq. ( 4.54) as a type of generalized reward, then the second term (i.e., the\npenalty term) can be viewed as a form of regularization for th e reward model, except that here the\ngoal is to train the policy rather than the reward model. Anot her example is that Eisenstein et al.\n[2023 ] develop a regularization term based on the squared sum of re wards, and add it to the\npairwise comparison loss in RLHF:\nLreg=Lpair+ (−E(x,ya,yb)∼D r[r(x,ya) +r(x,yb)]2)\n=−E(x,ya,yb)∼D r[log Pr φ(ya≻yb|x)]\n−E(x,ya,yb)∼D r[r(x,ya) +r(x,yb)]2(4.63)\nOptimizing with this regularization term can help mitigate the underdetermination of reward mod-\nels5.\n4.4.1.2 Sparse Rewards vs. Dense Rewards\nAs discussed in Section 4.3, the rewards in RLHF are very sparse: they are observed only a t the\nend of sequences, rather than continuously throughout the g eneration process. Dealing with sparse\nrewards has long been a concern in reinforcement learning, a nd has been one of the challenges in\nmany practical applications. For example, in robotics, it o ften needs to shape the reward function\nto ease optimization rather than relying solely on end-of-s equence rewards. Various methods\nhave been developed to address this issue. One common approa ch is reward shaping, where the\noriginal function is modiﬁed to include intermediate rewar ds, thereby providing more immediate\nfeedback. Also, one can adopt curriculum learning to sequen tially structure tasks in a way that the\ncomplexity gradually increases. This can help models to mas ter simpler tasks ﬁrst, which prepares\nthem for more complex challenges as their skills develop. Th ere are many such methods that can\nmitigate the impact of sparse rewards, such as Monte Carlo me thods and intrinsic motivation. Most\nof these methods are general and the discussion of them can be found in the broader literature on\nreinforcement learning, such as Sutton and Barto [2018 ]’s book.\nAlthough we do not discuss methods for mitigating sparse rew ards in detail here, an interesting\nquestion arises: why are sparse rewards so successful in RLH F? Recall from Section 4.3.1 that\nthe supervision signal received at each time step tis not the reward for the current action, but\n5A model is called underdetermined if there are multiple alte rnative sets of parameters that can achieve the same\nobjective.\n\n--- Page 197 ---\n\n190 Alignment\nrather some form of the accumulated rewards from tuntil the last time step. Such supervision\nsignals are dense over the sequence, because the reward obta ined at the end of the sequence can\nbe transferred back to that time step, regardless of which ti me step it is. In other words, the sparse\nrewards are transformed into the dense supervision signals . Furthermore, from the perspective of\nreward shaping, Ng et al.

[1999 ] show that the reward at tcan be deﬁned as\nr′(st,at,st+1) =r(st,at,st+1) +f(st,at,st+1) (4.64)\nwherer′(·)is the transformed reward function, r(·)is the original reward function, and f(·)is\nthe shaping reward function. To ensure the optimality of the policy under the transformed reward\nfunction, the shaping reward function can be given in the for m\nf(st,at,st+1) =γΦ(st+1)−Φ(st) (4.65)\nwhere Φ(s)is called the potential value of the state s. If we deﬁne Φ(s)as the common value\nfunction as in Eq. ( 4.15) and substitute Eq. ( 4.65) into Eq. ( 4.64), we obtain\nr′(st,at,st+1) =r(st,at,st+1) +γV(st+1)−V(st) (4.66)\nIt is interesting to see that this function is exactly the sam e as the advantage function used in PPO.\nThis relates advantage-based methods to reward shaping: th e advantage is essentially a shaped\nreward.\nOn the other hand, one of the reasons for adopting end-of-seq uence rewards lies in the nature\nof the RLHF tasks. Unlike traditional reinforcement learni ng environments where the agent in-\nteracts with a dynamic environment, RLHF tasks often involv e complex decision-making based\non linguistic or other high-level cognitive processes. The se processes do not lend themselves eas-\nily to frequent and meaningful intermediate rewards becaus e the quality and appropriateness of\nthe actions can only be fully evaluated after observing thei r impact in the larger context of the\nentire sequence or task. In this case, the reward signals bas ed on human feedback, though very\nsparse, are typically very informative and accurate. Conse quently, this sparsity, together with the\nhigh informativeness and accuracy of the human feedback, ca n make the learning both robust and\nefﬁcient.\n4.4.1.3 Fine-grained Rewards\nFor many applications, our objective will be more complex th an merely evaluating an entire text.\nFor example, in sentiment analysis, we often do not just dete rmine the sentiment of a text, but need\nto analyze the sentiment in more detail by associating it wit h speciﬁc aspects of a topic discussed\nin the text. Consider the sentence \"The camera of the phone is excellent, but the battery life is\ndisappointing.\" In this example, we would need to separatel y analyze the sentiments expressed\nabout the camera and the battery. Such analysis, known as asp ect-based sentiment analysis, helps\nprovide a ﬁner-grained understanding of the customer revie w compared to general sentiment anal-\nysis.\nFor the problem of reward modeling, we often need to model dif ferent parts of a sequence as\nwell. A simple and straightforward way to do this is to divide a sequence into different segments\nand then compute the reward for each segment [ Wu et al. ,2023 ]. Suppose that an output token\n\n--- Page 198 ---\n\n4.4 Improved Human Preference Alignment 191\nsequence ycan be divided into nssegments {¯y1,...,¯yns}by some criterion. We can use the\nreward model to evaluate each of these segments. By taking x,yand¯ykas input to the reward\nmodel, the reward score for the k-th segment is given by\nrk=r(x,y,¯yk) (4.67)\nThen the reward score for the entire output sequence is given by\nr(x,y) =ns∑\nk=1r(x,y,¯yk) (4.68)\nHerer",

Suppose that an output token\n\n--- Page 198 ---\n\n4.4 Improved Human Preference Alignment 191\nsequence ycan be divided into nssegments {¯y1,...,¯yns}by some criterion. We can use the\nreward model to evaluate each of these segments. By taking x,yand¯ykas input to the reward\nmodel, the reward score for the k-th segment is given by\nrk=r(x,y,¯yk) (4.67)\nThen the reward score for the entire output sequence is given by\nr(x,y) =ns∑\nk=1r(x,y,¯yk) (4.68)\nHerer(x,y)can be used to train the policy as usual.\nA problem with this model is that training reward models at th e segment level is not as straight-\nforward as learning from human preferences on entire texts, as it is difﬁcult to obtain segment-level\nhuman preference data. For rating-like problems (e.g., we r ate a segment according to its level\nof misinformation), one simple approach is to assign a ratin g score to each segment and train the\nreward model using pointwise methods. For example, we can us e a strong LLM to rate the se-\nquences ¯y1...¯yk−1and¯y1...¯yk, and obtain the scores s(¯y1...¯yk−1)ands(¯y1...¯yk). We can then\ndeﬁne the score of the segment ¯ykas the difference between s(¯y1...¯yk)ands(¯y1...¯yk−1)\ns(¯yk) =s(¯y1...¯yk)−s(¯y1...¯yk−1) (4.69)\nUsing these segment-level scores, we can train the reward mo del with a regression loss func-\ntion\nLrating =−E¯yk[s(¯yk)−r(x,y,¯yk)]2(4.70)\nSometimes, alignment can be treated as a classiﬁcation prob lem, for example, we assess\nwhether a segment has ethical issues. In this case, the segme nt can be labeled as ethical or\nunethical, either by humans or using additional classiﬁers . Given the label of the segment, we\ncan train the reward model using some classiﬁcation loss fun ction. For example, suppose that\nr(x,y,¯yk) = 1 if the segment is classiﬁed as unethical, and r(x,y,¯yk) =−1otherwise6. The\nhinge loss of training binary classiﬁcation models is given by\nLhinge = max(0,1−r(x,y,¯yk)·ˆr) (4.71)\nwhere ˆr∈ {1,−1}denotes the ground truth label.\nThe remaining issue here is how to split yinto segments. One approach is to deﬁne a ﬁxed-\nlength segmentation, where yis divided into equal-length chunks. However, this may not a lways\nbe ideal, as the content of the sequence may not align well wit h ﬁxed boundaries. An alternative\napproach is to segment ybased on speciﬁc linguistic or semantic cues, such as senten ce bound-\naries, topic shifts, or other meaningful structures in the t ext. Such a segmentation can be achieved\nby using linguistic segmentation systems or prompting LLMs to identify natural breaks in the se-\nquence.

We can also\nexplain this through Goodhart’s law, which states: when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to\nbe a good measure [Goodhart ,1984 ].\nAddressing the overoptimization problem is not easy, and th ere is no mature solution yet. The\nideal approach might be to develop an oracle reward model tha t can perfectly capture the true\nobjectives of the task and prevent the agent from “tricking” . However, creating such a model is\nextremely difﬁcult due to the complexity of the real-world e nvironment, as well as the challenge\nof deﬁning all the relevant factors that contribute to the de sired outcome. Instead, a more practical\napproach is to combine multiple reward models, thereby alle viating the misalignment between\nthe training objective and the true objective that arises fr om using a single, speciﬁc reward model\n[Coste et al. ,2024 ].\nGiven a set of reward models, combining them is straightforw ard, and in some cases, we can\nsimply treat this problem as an ensemble learning problem. A simple yet common approach is to\naverage the outputs of these models to obtain a more precise r eward estimation:\nrcombine =1\nNK∑\nk=1wk·rk(x,y) (4.72)\nwhererk(·)is thek-th reward model in the ensemble, wkis the weight of rk(·), andKis the\nnumber of reward models. This combined reward can then be use d to supervise the training of\na policy. In fact, there are many ways to combine different mo dels, for example, one can make\npredictions using Bayesian model averaging or develop a fus ion network to learn to combine the\npredictions from different models. Alternatively, one can frame this task as a multi-objective\noptimization problem, and use multiple reward models to tra in the policy simultaneously. These\nmethods have been intensively discussed in the literature o n optimization and machine learning\n[Miettinen ,1999 ;Bishop ,2006 ].\nIn addition to model combination methods, another importan t issue is how to collect or con-\nstruct multiple different reward models. One of the simples t approaches is to employ ensemble\nlearning techniques, such as developing diverse reward mod els from different subsets of a given\ndataset or from various data sources. For RLHF, it is also pos sible to construct reward models\nbased on considerations of different aspects of alignment. For example, we can develop a reward\nmodel to evaluate the factual accuracy of the output and anot her reward model to evaluate the\n7This problem is also called reward hacking orreward gaming [Krakovna et al. ,2020 ;Skalse et al. ,2022 ;\nPan et al. ,2022 ], which refers to the phenomenon where the agent attempts to trick the reward model but fails to\nalign its actions with the true intended objectives of the ta sk.

These two models are complement ary to each other, and can be com-\nbined to improve the overall evaluation of the output. Anoth er approach is to employ different\noff-the-shelf LLMs as reward models. This approach is simpl e and practical, as there have been\na lot of well-developed LLMs and we just need to use them with n o or little modiﬁcation. An\ninteresting issue, though not closely related to the discus sion here, arises: can an LLM that aligns\nwith other LLMs outperform those LLMs? Probably not at ﬁrst g lance. In part, this is because\nthe target LLM merely imitates other LLMs based on limited su pervision and thus cannot capture\nwell the nuances of the behaviors of these supervisors. Howe ver, given the strong generalization\nability of LLMs, this approach can, in fact, be quite beneﬁci al. For example, using open-sourced\nor commercial LLMs as reward models has demonstrated strong performance in aligning LLMs,\neven achieving state-of-the-art results on several popula r tasks [ Lambert et al. ,2024 ].\n4.4.2 Direct Preference Optimization\nAlthough learning reward models is a standard step in reinfo rcement learning, it makes the entire\ntraining process much more complex than supervised trainin g. Training a reliable reward model\nis itself not an easy task, and a poorly trained reward model c an greatly affect the outcome of\npolicy learning. We now consider an alternative alignment m ethod, called direct preference op-\ntimization (DPO ), which simpliﬁes the training framework by eliminating th e need to explicitly\nmodel rewards [ Rafailov et al. ,2024 ]. This method directly optimizes the policy based on user\npreferences, rather than developing a separate reward mode l. As a result, we can achieve human\npreference alignment in a supervised learning-like fashio n. Figure 4.10 shows a comparison of\nthe standard RLHF method and the DPO method.\nBefore deriving the DPO objective, let us ﬁrst review the obj ective of policy training used in\nRLHF. As discussed in Section 4.3.3 , the policy is typically trained by optimizing a loss functi on\n\n--- Page 201 ---\n\n194 Alignment\nwith a penalty term.

This is a strong assumption compared with PPO, but as will be shown later, it simpliﬁes\nthe problem and crucial for deriving the DPO objective.\nSinceθis the variable we want to optimize, we rearrange the right-h and",

( 4.80), we can apply it to the Bradley-Terry model to calculate the\npreference probability (also see Section 4.3.2 ):\nPrθ(ya≻yb|x) = Sigmoid( r(x,ya)−r(x,yb))\n= Sigmoid(\nβ(\nlogπθ(ya|x)\nπθref(ya|x)+ logZ(x))\n−\nβ(\nlogπθ(yb|x)\nπθref(yb|x)+ logZ(x)))\n= Sigmoid(\nβlogπθ(ya|x)\nπθref(ya|x)−βlogπθ(yb|x)\nπθref(yb|x))\n(4.81)\n\n--- Page 203 ---\n\n196 Alignment\nThis formula is elegant because it converts the difference i n rewards into the difference in\nratio functions, and we do not need to calculate the value of Z(x). A direct result is that we no\nlonger need a reward model, but only need the target policy an d reference model to calculate the\nprobability of preferences. Finally, we can train the targe t policy by minimizing the following\nDPO loss function\nLdpo(θ) = −E(x,ya,yb)∼D r[log Pr θ(ya≻yb|x)](4.82)\nThe form of this loss function is very similar to that used in t raining reward models in RLHF (see\nEq. ( 4.36)). But it should be noted that the loss function here depends on the parameters of the\npolicy (i.e.,θ) rather than the parameters of the reward model (i.e., φ).\nThe main advantage of DPO lies in its simplicity and efﬁcienc y. The DPO objective is very\nstraightforward — it directly optimizes for preference-ba sed feedback, rather than relying on sep-\narately developed reward models. Moreover, DPO is generall y more sample-efﬁcient, as it learns\nfrom a ﬁxed dataset without the need for the computationally expensive sampling process used\nin PPO. This makes DPO a popular method for human preference a lignment, especially when\ndeveloping and applying reward models via reinforcement le arning is challenging.\nDPO can broadly be viewed as an ofﬂine reinforcement learning method, where the training\ndata is pre-collected and ﬁxed, and there is no exploration. In contrast, online reinforcement learn-\ning methods like PPO, which require exploring new states thr ough interaction with the environ-\nment (using the reward model as a proxy), also have their uniq ue advantages. One of the beneﬁts\nof online reinforcement learning is that it allows the agent to continuously adapt to changes in\nthe environment by learning from real-time feedback.

Using human feedback does not only faces the problem of\nlimited scalability, but it may also introduce bias because human feedback is inherently subjective.\nAs a result, one can turn to AI feedback methods to address the se scalability and consistency issues\nwithout the limitations associated with human annotators.\nAs with data generation for instruction ﬁne-tuning, genera ting preference data using LLMs is\nstraightforward. Given a set of inputs, we ﬁrst use an LLM to g enerate pairs of outputs. Then, we\nprompt the LLM to label the preference between each pair of ou tputs, along with its corresponding\ninput. Below is an example of prompting the LLM to generate a p reference label for a pair of\nconsumer service responses.\n\n--- Page 204 ---\n\n4.4 Improved Human Preference Alignment 197\nConsider a customer service scenario where a customer poses a request. You\nwill review two responses to this request. Please indicate w hich response is\npreferred. Note that a good response should be courteous, cl ear, and concise. It\nshould address the customer’s concern directly, provide he lpful information or a\nsolution, and maintain a positive tone.\nRequest:\nHello, I noticed that my order hasn’t arrived yet, though it w as scheduled to\narrive several days ago. Could you please update me on its sta tus? Thank you!\nResponse A:\nI’m very sorry for the delay and understand how disappointin g this can be. We’re\ndoing our best to sort this out quickly for you.\nResponse B:\nHey, stuff happens! Your package will get there when it gets t here, no need to\nstress.\nResponse A is preferred.\nOnce we collect such preference labels, we can use them, alon g with the output pair and input,\nto train the reward model. Of course, we can consider demonst rating a few examples or using\nadvanced prompting techniques, such as CoT, to improve labe ling performance. For example, we\ncan include in the prompt an example showing how and why one of the two responses is preferred\nbased on a CoT rationale.\nIn addition to preference labels, we can also obtain the prob ability associated with each label\n[Lee et al. ,2023 ]. A simple method is to extract the probabilities for the lab el tokens, such as “A”\nand “B”, from the probabilities output by the LLM. We can then use the Softmax function or other\nnormalization techniques to re-normalize these probabili ties into a distribution over the labels.\nThese probabilities of preferred labels can serve as pointw ise supervision signals for training the\nreward model, as discussed in Section 4.4.1 .\nFor data generation, although it is easy to scale up, it is oft en necessary to ensure the data is\naccurate and diverse.

These methods ca n be easily adapted to scenarios where\nthe correctness of an output can be examined by checking whet her the desired result is included.\nFor example, in the task of calculating a mathematical expre ssion, a reward model can provide\npositive feedback if the answer is correct, and negative fee dback if the answer is wrong. How-\never, in many problems that require complex reasoning, simp ly examining the correctness of the\nﬁnal result is insufﬁcient for learning. Imagine a student w ho is only given the ﬁnal answer to\na challenging math problem. Knowing whether the ﬁnal answer is right or wrong does not help\nthe student ﬁgure out where they went wrong and how to calcula te the correct answer. A better\napproach would be to guide the student with a step-by-step br eakdown of the problem-solving\nprocess and encourage understanding of the underlying conc epts and logic behind these steps.\nIn Chapter 3, we studied CoT methods to prompt LLMs to explici tly write out intermediate\nsteps or the reasoning process needed to reach a conclusion o r solve a problem. We saw that\nbreaking down a problem into smaller parts could make it easi er to understand the solution path\nand increase the accuracy of the output. These methods can be naturally extended to the alignment\nof LLMs, that is, we supervise the model during the intermedi ate steps of reasoning. Consider a\nreasoning task where an LLM produces a sequence of reasoning steps y={¯y1,...,¯yns}for the\ngiven input. The result of the reasoning is assumed to be incl uded in the last step ¯yns, and can\nbe easily veriﬁed. For this reasoning problem, Uesato et al. [2022 ] categorize LLM ﬁne-tuning\napproaches into two classes:\n•Outcome-based Approaches . Supervision occurs only when the end result is veriﬁed. Thi s\nis a standard method for learning from human feedback we have discussed in this chapter.\nFor example, the LLM is optimized to maximize some form of the rewardr(x,y).\n•Process-based Approaches . Supervision is involved in all intermediate steps in addit ion to\nthe last step. To do this, we need to develop a model to give a su pervision signal at each\nstep, and develop loss functions that can make use of such sup ervision signals.\nFigure 4.11 shows two LLM outputs for an example math problem. Although t he LLM gives\nthe correct ﬁnal answer in both cases, it makes mistakes duri ng the problem-solving process in the\nsecond output. Outcome-based approaches overlook these mi stakes and give positive feedback for\nthe entire solution. By contrast, process-based approache s can take these mistakes into account\nand provide additional guidance on the detailed reasoning s teps.\nAn important issue for process-based approaches is that we n eed to get step-level feedback\nduring a (potentially) long reasoning path.

Moreover, we can consider various aspects when asse ssing the quality of a step, rather\nthan just its correctness. For example, in dialogue systems , responses must not only be accurate\nbut also contextually appropriate across multiple turns of conversation. If a model provides a\ncorrect response but fails to maintain coherence in the cont ext of the ongoing dialogue, step-\nlevel feedback could help the model identify and correct suc h discrepancies.

All these approaches essentially aim to provide more detai led supervision to\nLLMs by breaking their outputs into smaller, more manageabl e steps. However, process-based\nfeedback focuses more on evaluating the correctness of a ste p based on its preceding steps, while\nthe approaches in Section 4.4.1.3 emphasize evaluating each step independently.\nThe idea of aligning LLMs step by step has great application p otential, especially considering\nthe recent shift towards more complex reasoning tasks in the use of LLMs. For example, both\nthe GPT-o1 and GPT-o3 models are designed with more advanced reasoning techniques (such\nas long internal CoT) to solve challenging problems like sci entiﬁc and mathematical reasoning\n[OpenAI ,2024 ]. These tasks often rely on long and complex reasoning paths , and therefore, it\nseems essential to introduce detailed supervision signals in the reasoning process. Moreover, from\na practical perspective, effective supervision on long rea soning paths not only improves reasoning\nperformance, but it also helps the model eliminate redundan t or unnecessary reasoning steps,\nthereby reducing reasoning complexity and improving efﬁci ency.\n4.4.5 Inference-time Alignment\nIn this section we explored a variety of methods to align mode ls with human preferences and an-\nnotations.

Once the N-best output candidates are generated, the\nreward model is used to evaluate and select the best one:\nˆybest = max {r(x,ˆy1),...,r (x,ˆyN)} (4.86)\nIt is worth noting that the result of BoN sampling is also inﬂu enced by the diversity of the\nN-best list. This is a common issue with most reranking method s. Typically, we wish the N-best\noutput candidates to have relatively high quality but be suf ﬁciently different from each other. In\nmany text generation systems, the N-best outputs are very similar, often differing by just one\nor two words. The diversity issue is even more challenging in LLMs, as the N-best outputs\ngenerated by an LLM can be different in their wordings, yet th eir semantic meanings are often\nquite similar. In practice, one can adjust the model hyperpa rameters and/or adopt different LLMs\nto generate more diverse output candidates for reranking. N evertheless, as with many practical\nsystems, we need to make a trade-off between selecting high- quality candidates and ensuring\nsufﬁcient variation in the generated outputs.\nBoN sampling can be used for training LLMs as well. A closely r elated method is rejection\nsampling . In this method, we ﬁrst select the “best” outputs from the N-best lists via the reward\nmodel, and then take these selected outputs to ﬁne-tune the L LM. In this way, we can introduce\nhuman preferences into the training of LLMs via a much simple r approach compared to RLHF.\nMany LLMs have adopted rejection sampling for ﬁne-tuning [ Nakano et al. ,2021 ;Touvron et al. ,\n2023b ].\n4.5 Summary\nIn this chapter, we have explored a range of techniques for al igning LLMs. In particular, we\nhave discussed ﬁne-tuning methods that enable LLMs to follo w instructions and align them with\nhuman preferences.

However, we have tried\nto provide a relatively detailed introduction to the fundam ental approaches to alignment, such as\nissues are not often discussed in the context of LLMs. For exa mple, suppose we have an old model and a new, more\npowerful model. We can use the new model to select the best out put from the N-best list of the old model as the oracle\noutput. The performance difference between the oracle outp ut and the top-1 output of the original N-best list reﬂects\nthe performance gain brought by the new model. If the perform ance gain is signiﬁcant, we can say that the old model\nhas more model errors. If the gain is small, it may indicate th at the issue lies in search errors, as the best candidates\nwere not found.\n\n--- Page 209 ---\n\n202 Alignment\ninstruction ﬁne-tuning and RLHF.\nWhile we have focused on LLM alignment techniques in this cha pter, the term AI alignment\nis a wide-ranging concept. It generally refers to the proces s of ensuring that the behavior of an AI\nsystem aligns with human values, goals, and expectations. T he idea of AI alignment can be traced\nback to the early days of AI. A widely cited description of AI a lignment comes from an article by\nthe mathematician and computer scientist Norbert Wiener [ Wiener ,1960 ]. The quote is as follows\nIf we use, to achieve our purposes, a mechanical agency with w hose operation\nwe cannot efﬁciently interfere ... we had better be quite sur e that the purpose\nput into the machine is the purpose which we really desire.\nAt that time, AI alignment was a distant concern for research ers. But today, it greatly inﬂu-\nences the design of various AI systems. For example, in robot ics, alignment is critical to ensur-\ning that autonomous robots safely interact with humans and t heir environments. In autonomous\ndriving, cars must not only follow trafﬁc laws but also make c omplex, real-time decisions that\nprioritize human safety, avoid accidents, and navigate eth ical dilemmas.\nIn current AI research, alignment is usually achieved by dev eloping a surrogate objective that\nis analogous to the real goal and steering the AI system towar ds this objective. However, designing\nthe objective of AI alignment is very difﬁcult. One reason is that human values are diverse and\noften context-dependent, making it difﬁcult to distill the m into a single, universally applicable\nobjective function. Also, the complexity of real-world env ironments, where values and goals often\nconﬂict or evolve over time, further complicates alignment efforts. Even if we could deﬁne an\nappropriate objective, AI systems may ﬁnd unintended ways t o achieve it, leading to “misaligned”\noutcomes that still technically satisfy the objective but i n a harmful or counterproductive way.\nThese challenges have motivated and are motivating AI resea rch towards more aligned sys-\ntems, either through developing new mechanisms for perceiv ing the world or more efﬁcient and\ngeneralizable methods to adapt these systems to given tasks . More importantly, as AI systems\nbecome more powerful and intelligent, especially given tha t recent advances in LLMs have shown\nremarkable capabilities in dealing with many challenging p roblems, the need for AI alignment\nhas become more urgent. Researchers have started to be conce rned with AI safety and warn the\ncommunity that they need to develop and release AI systems wi th great caution to prevent these\nsystems from being misaligned [ Russell ,2019 ;Bengio et al. ,2024 ].\n\n--- Page 210 ---\n\nBibliography\n[Ainslie et al., 2020] Joshua Ainslie, Santiago",
